The MVP Summit is coming up next week, and it is always a fantastic time to network and get caught up with my friends literally from around the world.  One of the big challenges of Summit is just finding people, so this post will serve as the guidepost of how to find me at Summit.  First and foremost is FourSquare, I'll post whenever I arrive at a location.  Even if I'm not allowed to disclose why I'm somewhere, because of NDA topics, I can discuss that I'm somewhere, like "Building 92 on the MSFT Campus".  But beyond that, there are several public events which I can disclose I'll be at, so lets list those out.
