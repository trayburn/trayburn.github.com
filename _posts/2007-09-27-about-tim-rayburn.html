<p><img alt="" hspace="10" align="left" vspace="10" src="http://timrayburn.net/TimRayburn-Web.png" />Giving in to the fact that every blog should be able to tell you something about it's author, this post will serve as a bit of introduction to me and give you a little bit of my history.</p>
<p>My name is Tim Rayburn, and I am currently employed as a Principal Consultant with <a href="http://www.improvingenterprises.com">Improving Enterprises</a> and I am&nbsp;a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) for Connected Systems Development.&nbsp; I'm fairly heavily involved with the Microsoft community, I am the President of the Dallas Connected Systems User Group, I commonly speak at user groups throughout Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas as well as at conferences such as the Tulsa TechFest, Houston TechFest, VSLive! Austin, Microsoft TechEd and the Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference.&nbsp; In 2009 I was selected to be a member of the INETA Speaker's Bureau,&nbsp;which affords me the ability to travel around the nation talking with people about .NET technologies.</p>
<p>I grew up in New York City, moved with my family to Connecticut when I was entering the 6th grade, graduated from Glastonbury High School and then after some community college moved with my family again to the Dallas/Fort Worth area of Texas where I reside still today even though much of my family no longer lives in this area.&nbsp; I do not have a bachelor's degree, but I have in the past attended Manchester Community College (in Manchester, CT), and later the University of Texas at Arlington.&nbsp; I still live in Arlington with my lovely wife Kate and our&nbsp;Australian Shepard&nbsp;named Gandalf.</p>
<p>I am a certifiable geek, and unabashedly so.&nbsp; I own multiple gaming consoles, play table top RPG's, love board games of all sorts, and still have a weekly gathering to play D&amp;D (or whatever we're playing at the moment) with my friends.&nbsp; In 2008 I launched a podcast about Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fourth Edition called <a href="http://hommlet.com">Radio Free Hommlet</a>.&nbsp; In the past I've also been deeply involved with a wonderful organization called the <a href="http://www.sca.org">Society for Creative Anachronism</a>, but have not been active with them for many years.</p>
<p>I'm always happy to talk to folks in the community about their latest project or about coming out to their conference, code camp, code mash, etc.&nbsp; Please feel free to reach out at <a href="mailto:Tim@TimRayburn.net">Tim@TimRayburn.net</a> if you have questions or would like me to come out and speak.</p>
