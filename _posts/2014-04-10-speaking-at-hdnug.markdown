Tonight I'm speaking at the Houston .NET User Group, my talk is entitled "Black Belt MVC" and covers a lot of interesting framework minutia about ASP.NET MVC.  You can find the details about the presentation here : [http://hdnug.org/events_view.aspx?eventid=99](http://hdnug.org/events_view.aspx?eventid=99)
