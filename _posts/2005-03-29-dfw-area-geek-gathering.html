<A href="http://addressof.com">Cory Smith</A> is <A href="http://addressof.com/blog/archive/2005/03/29/1612.aspx">putting together a Geek Gathering at the Main Event in Grapevine</A>. I agree with Cory that User Groups and other meetings are great, but not a good place to socialize. So you can count me in!
