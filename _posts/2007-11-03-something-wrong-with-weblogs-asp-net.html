<p>Something weird is going on with Weblogs.ASP.NET I think, perhaps it's haunted since Halloween, but today I got feed retrieval errors for three blogs I monitor there:</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/despos/">Dino Esposito</a></li> <li><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/erobillard/">Eli Robillard</a></li> <li><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/nunitaddin/">Jamie Cansdale</a></li></ul> <p>I don't know if there is something in common here, but it seems mighty odd.</p>
