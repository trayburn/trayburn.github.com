<p>I'm pleased to report that I've been accepted into &quot;The Hidden Network&quot; of HiddenNetwork.com.&nbsp; You can now find job listings from companies interested in hiring those who care about their trade on the sidebar of my blog.</p>
<p>Likewise, employers you can link from the side of my blog directly to a form allowing you to reach the best and brightest in technology.&nbsp; Unlike the hordes at Monster, this network is based around those dedicated enough to read blogs which relate to their field.</p>
