<p>This last Saturday I had the honor of presenting at the first Houston TechFest.&nbsp; Michael and his crew deserve to be congratulated in pulling this off so well.&nbsp; The found the balance between number of topics and number of tracks just right, and they pulled in over 450 people for the event.</p> <p>Sogeti was there in force, with our Houston office going above and beyond.&nbsp; We had no less than 3 speakers (Ben Scheirman, Mike Azocar and myself), each giving two talks, and then members of the TechFest staff, and finally a table in the sponsor area with many friendly faces connecting with the developers there.</p> <p>I gave my "Introduction to C# 3.0" talk to well over 100 developers in the large Houston Room, and early that day spoke to 20 valiant souls who showed up to "Introduction to BizTalk Server 2006".&nbsp; Both groups were absolutely great and it was a pleasure to meet everyone.</p> <p>Thank you to everyone in Houston who made this event possible, and I look forward to next year!</p>
