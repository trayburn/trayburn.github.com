I've recently started developing for Windows Phone 7 because my apprentices have been very interested in the mobile space.  My first application is a utility used by players in [Star Wars : The Old Republic][swtor] called [Pylon Solver][app].  The application is a solver for the Ancient Pylons puzzle in Eternity Vault.  But unlike so many of the apps out there, this one addresses a common problem, it is color-blind friendly.  Most of the solvers out there use just the colors, not the shapes, from the game.  This app uses both to provide a quick easy interface to solving the puzzle.  I'd appreciate any [SWTOR][swtor] players out there downloading it, trying it out, and letting me know what they think, and leave a review.
