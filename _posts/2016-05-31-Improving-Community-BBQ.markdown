It is BBQ time at Improving, and we'd like you to come!  Last year we started
what we hope will be a tradition at Improving of hosting a BBQ where we invite
all of our friends from the community to hang out, eat BBQ that has been prepared
by the talented Improving BBQ Team, and have a good time.  In the second year
we've decided to move the event to a holiday weekend to make it easier on you,
and us, to prepare.  Fortunately this year the Fourth of July decided to cooperate
and land on a Monday, and there you are.

On July 4th, 2016 we will be serving a BBQ lunch from 11am to 1pm at our offices
for anyone who signs up and tells us that they're coming.  All you need to do is:

# [REGISTER](http://improving-bbq.eventbrite.com)

You're free to bring your family and friends, to enjoy this meal with us.  Also
yes, we will have options for our vegetarian friends as well, so don't stay away
just because it is BBQ.  Last year that option included Smoked Sweet Potato,
Green Bean Casserole, and Grilled Pineapple.  This year's menu is not yet set,
but should be equivalent.
