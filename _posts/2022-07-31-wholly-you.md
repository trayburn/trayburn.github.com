Real connections are vulnerable

Many leaders believe that great leadership is antiseptic. Devoid of context and connection.
I contend that great leadership is open, personal, vulnerable and built on trust.
Respecting how open your team chooses to be, you should lead with trust being Wholly You
Be a leader, and a watersports fanatic. Be a leader, and a BBQ fanatic.
Show them you're comfortable being Wholly You and perhaps they will trust enough to be Wholly Them.

From there comes connection:
- compassion
- understanding
- engagement
- joy

And that of course makes all the difference in the world.
