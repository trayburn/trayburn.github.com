On this coming Thursday, May 22nd, I'll be speaking to the [CODNUG on Entity Framework and the Repository and Specification patterns](http://condg.org/archive/2014/05/13/May-2014-Meeting-Announcement---Repository-and-Specification-Patterns-with.aspx).  I'll be in town all day Thursday, working from the Improving offices.  If you'd like to chat, drop me a line.
