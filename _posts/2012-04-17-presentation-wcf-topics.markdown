This morning I had the pleasure of review the basics of WCF with a group from Exxon.  As promised to them I've made all code and presentations from that talk available at [GitHub][gh].  Thank you all for attending, and again if you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me at Tim@TimRayburn.net.
