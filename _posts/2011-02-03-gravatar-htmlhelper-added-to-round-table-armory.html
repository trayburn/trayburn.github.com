title: "Gravatar HtmlHelper added to Round Table : Armory"
layout: post

<p>As part of my efforts around introducing Round Table : Squire, I’ve started a project to centralize useful pieces of code which have application across many projects.&#160; One of these was my code I wrote about some time ago, a <a href="http://timrayburn.net/blog/gravatars-in-asp-net-mvc-using-htmlhelper/">Gravatar HtmlHelper extension</a>.&#160; I’ve now centralized that code, the body of which can be seen below, into the <a href="https://github.com/roundtable/Armory">Round Table : Armory project on github</a>.&#160; If you’d like the full code, with all the tests, then just head over to the repository and download or clone it.&#160; If you have improvements, please feel free to send me a pull request.</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/809567.js?file=Gravatar.cs"></script>
