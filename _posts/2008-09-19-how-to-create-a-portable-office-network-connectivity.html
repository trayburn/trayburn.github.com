<h2>Phones</h2> <h3>AT&amp;T Tilt</h3> <p><img height="194" alt="AT&amp;T Tilt" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowToCreateaPortableOfficeNetworkConnect_CDBF/AT&amp;T%20Tilt_3afe075f-4312-45fb-82d8-f0c390c1fc1d.jpg" width="240" align="left" border="0">I've carried an AT&amp;T Tilt for nearly a year now as my primary personal phone.&nbsp; I truly love this phone, Windows Mobile 6, GPS, WiFi, full keyboard, 3 mega-pixel camera, and high speed networking is fabulous.&nbsp; I've been with AT&amp;T for several years now.&nbsp; I was an AT&amp;T Wireless customer, then I was a Cingular customer, now I'm an AT&amp;T customer again so I've got a really good deal on a tethering plan for this unit as well which makes it Option 3 in my always connected plan.</p> <h3>T-Mobile Dash</h3> <p>I've just begun to carry a T-Mobile Dash as my work phone.&nbsp; It is replacing the 8700g (below) which I've carried for the last 2 years.&nbsp; While it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the Tilt, it is running Windows Mobile, and so I can keep my mobile helpers on it as well.</p> <h3>Blackberry 8700g</h3> <p>My Blackberry that I've carried for many years is great for all the reasons that BBerries are great, and horrible for several other reasons.&nbsp; First and foremost, the thing refuses to power of nearly any scheme other than a true Blackberry charger.&nbsp; In my opinion, if I can't charge you off of a USB connection <strong>without</strong> special software installed, I'm not interested and that was the deal breaker for this otherwise great phone.</p> <h3>Sprint Wireless Card</h3> <p><img height="202" alt="Sprint Wireless Card" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowToCreateaPortableOfficeNetworkConnect_CDBF/Sprint%20Wireless%20Card_5d65ba28-b9dc-4b23-98ec-e9e8726d38e3.jpg" width="202" align="right" border="0"> I carry a Sprint Wireless Card as my primary mobile connectivity option (Option 2) in my backpack.&nbsp; I have nothing but gushing things to say about Sprint's network.&nbsp; As you can see from above, I commonly have had a chance to work with every network except Verizon for data, and Sprint is far and away the king.&nbsp; This wonderful ExpressCard slot item just works, and that is what I want from my technology.</p> <h2>Wireless Router</h2> <p><img height="202" alt="Linksys Compact Wireless Router" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowToCreateaPortableOfficeNetworkConnect_CDBF/Linksys%20Compact%20Wireless%20Router_cb835c29-20b4-4309-874a-54f8855cdf08.jpg" width="218" align="left" border="0"> So about now someone has to be asking ... seriously?&nbsp; You carry a router?&nbsp; Heck yes!&nbsp; My Linksys Compact Wireless Router has solved a ton of problems for me in the past, and takes up so little space I often forget I've got it until I get desperate.&nbsp; When I land at a hotel room for a conference, I'll pay for internet for my room and then share it out via this little baby.&nbsp; It has also saved the day when visiting clients without wireless capability (<strong>NOTE : Ask about this folks, often they don't have it for good reason</strong>) or when I'm on personal trips to family.&nbsp; It has also saved the day at the first We Are Microsoft event when we overloaded the wireless capabilities of the sites router.&nbsp; I plugged in and took Team Sogeti and several other teams onto this unit to clear up some spots.&nbsp; Get one, you won't regret it.</p> <h2>Network Cable</h2> <p><img height="180" alt="Cat5 Cable" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowToCreateaPortableOfficeNetworkConnect_CDBF/Cat5%20Cable_475dde97-93b5-45bf-9685-932f8e11c0dd.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0"> Eons ago, when .NET was young and I was trying to learn it, I attended a ton of MSDN events.&nbsp; Inevitably you got a little bag of swag, and in one of those bags I got this little gem, a self-winding network cable.&nbsp; It lives in my backpack, comes out when the client doesn't have wireless and has saved the day many times.</p>
