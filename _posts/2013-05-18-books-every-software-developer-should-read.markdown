Yesterday at AgileDotNet, before one of my sessions, we were discussing books which every software developer should read with the room, and particularly with a bunch of SMU students who came down to Houston to attend.  I promised I would post the list of those books to my blog, so here they are:

## The Must Read List (in Order)
- [Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design by Brett Mclaughlin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596008678/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596008678&linkCode=as2&tag=timraybnet-20)
- [Clean Code : A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship  by Robert Martin](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=timraybnet-20)
- [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition by Steve McConnell](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735619670&linkCode=as2&tag=timraybnet-20)
- [Refactoring to Patterns by Joshua Kerievsky](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321213351/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321213351&linkCode=as2&tag=timraybnet-20)
- [Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131177052/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0131177052&linkCode=as2&tag=timraybnet-20)
- [Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007124/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596007124&linkCode=as2&tag=timraybnet-20)

## Books You Should Read & Own Eventually
- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides aka "The Gang of Four"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SEIBB8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SEIBB8&linkCode=as2&tag=timraybnet-20)<br/>
This is the original work which brought about the terminology of Design Patterns.  We recommend the Head First book above over it simply because it's examples are in SmallTalk and C++, which means that its showing its age.
- [The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win by Kevin Behr](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0988262592/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0988262592&linkCode=as2&tag=timraybnet-20)<br/>
This book is a great story about how Operations and Developers can work together, and should be read by most teams trying to tighten their relationship with their operations team.
- [Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions by Bobby Woolf and Gregor Hohpe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321200683/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321200683&linkCode=as2&tag=timraybnet-20)<br/>
This book should be read and used as the bible for any distributed message application you build.  I'd remind you that these days most websites with APIs really are a distributed application.
