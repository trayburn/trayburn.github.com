<P>Just came <A href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Showpost.aspx?postid=126990">across a post from Channel 9</A> from back in October of 2005 which should be of interest to all BizTalk developers.&nbsp; It is a conversaton with members of the BizTalk Mapper development team about prototype improvements to the mapper which they had.&nbsp; The conversation runs on a bit, with introductions of lots of folks and such, so if you want to jump to the meat of the subject jump to time index 9:40 and watch the magic.</P><P>Unfortunately it does not appear that this has made the cut for <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/jun06/06-06EtEBusinessProcessPR.mspx">BizTalk Server 2006 R2</A>, which means we'll have to wait for the 2008 drop to get these toys. *sigh*</P>
