<P>I had the privilege tonight to speak at the Dallas .NET User Group.&nbsp; While December meetings are normally lightly attended, we had a good crowd who was very engaged on the subject matter.&nbsp; The talk reviewed XML namespaces, XPath syntax, and closed with a review of the XmlReader object in the .NET Framework.</P><A href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/BlackBeltXml.zip">The slides and code samples&nbsp;can be found here.</A> <P>I appreciate everyone giving me some of their time and I hope you learned something.</P>
