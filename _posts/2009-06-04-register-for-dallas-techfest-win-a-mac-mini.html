<p>No, you read that correctly.&nbsp; If you follow the link below and register for Dallas TechFest 2009 between now and June 14th, 2009 you will be entered into a drawing to win a Mac Mini.&nbsp; We've got lots of space around, so spread around the code to all your friends. Oh, and you'll also be getting <strong>$20 off the full ticket price on top of that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why tell your friends?</strong>&nbsp; Because if your friends tell us on their registration that you referred them, then you get an entry into the drawing as well.&nbsp; So spread the word on Twitter, your blog, your company's internal list, or anywhere else you think there are folks who would want to go to Dallas TechFest.</p>

<p><strong>But wait ... you're telling me I'm losing out because I registered early?&nbsp; Not at all!</strong></p>
<p>Nope, we're giving away another Mac Mini as well, as a special thank you to all those who registered early.</p>
