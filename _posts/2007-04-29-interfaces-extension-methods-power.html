<p>I spoke recently at <a href="http://DallasCodeCamp.com">Dallas Code Camp 2</a> about C# 3.0 and the new language features it contains.&nbsp; Most of the buzz on the net has been about LINQ, understandably, but as <a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/2007/03/21/Extension+Methods+TimRayburnExtensions+Beta+V01.aspx">I've mentioned here before I really, really, dig extension methods</a>.&nbsp; I've spent a good bit of time thinking about uses for them, and looking at how Microsoft has used them in .NET 3.5.</p> <p>One of the things that didn't click the first time I played with extension methods which you might have missed to is that you do not have to extend classes, you can extend interfaces.&nbsp; Think about that a moment, you can write methods, with functionality, that act upon interfaces.</p> <p>For example <a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/2006/10/12/Model+View+Presenter.aspx">I've previously spoken here about the Model View Presenter pattern</a>, which is normally implemented with an Interface (The View), a Data Access Object (The Model), and a class to map between them (The Presenter).&nbsp; "The Presenter" takes "The View" in it's constructor and simply acts upon "The View" in it's methods.&nbsp; "The View" is implemented as an interface because you can have multiple interfaces, but this requires another class for "The Presenter" because interfaces can't contain any code.&nbsp;<strong> Until Now.</strong></p> <p>With extension methods it becomes perfectly possible to forgo the need for a Presenter class in favor of a set of extension methods.&nbsp; Does this save typing?&nbsp; No, in all likelihood you've not save many keystrokes when writing your Presenter but you have gotten rid of the need to ever declare the Presenter on your pages/forms at all.&nbsp; If you implement IDisplayBlogPost on your ASP.NET page, then if you extend that interface with a method called "public static GetBlogPostByTitle(this IDisplayBlogPost view, string title)" then your page now has that method itself, and a simple "this.GetBlogPostByTitle(blogTitle);" can result in population of your page.</p> <p>This essentially brings to .NET the power of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance">Multiple Inheritance</a> without the problems with Multiple Inheritance that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_%28programming_language%29">exist</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">in</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">certain</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System">other</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logtalk">languages</a>.</p> <p>I'm still downloading Beta 1 of Orcas, but rest assured code samples for this are coming.</p>
