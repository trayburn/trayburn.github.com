<p>I'm in Arizona currently, specifically Phoenix, and last night I had the chance to speak at the AZ.NET User Group thanks to the wonderful folks at INETA.&nbsp; I promised the folks there that the slides would be posted last night, so I'm only about 8 hours late.&nbsp; The talk was an Introduction to Windows Communication Foundation, and the demos focused on showing a simple service being setup from nothing to running.</p> <p>You can <a href="http://TimRayburn.net/files/uploads/IntroToWCF.pptx">download the slides here</a>, or <a href="http://TimRayburn.net/files/uploads/PhxWCF.zip">the final code here</a>.</p>
