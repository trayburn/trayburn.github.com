<p>Writing great software is an immense joy in my life.&#160; I truly enjoy working with business users and other developers to craft software which can make a marked and immediate difference for a business, something that presents real value.&#160; There isn’t a lot of rocket science here, it goes to the fundamental desire of all humans to make a difference in our world.</p>  <p>Fortunately for those who are looking for ways to do so, our world is full of situations that need to be adjusted.&#160; One of them, with all due respect to those in our industry who cling to their cherished degrees from universities, is that <strong>you do not need a four year degree to craft great software.</strong>&#160; Now certainly we all know people who have been successful without a traditional education, in fact you’re reading the blog of one right now.&#160; And I will be the first to tell anyone leaving High School that a four year degree is your most certain path to success in software development.&#160; But for some, that ship has sailed.</p>  <p>For some, the reality of life is such that leaving work is beyond their reach because of the need to support themselves.&#160; One such person as this is Christopher Jackson, a good friend of mine that has exceptional analytic skills but who also finds himself functionally unemployed currently, having lost his last job to a downsize from the economy, he now acts as a substitute teacher in the <a href="http://www.fwisd.org/hcm/Pages/position_sub.aspx">Fort Worth Independent School District</a> for the incredible sum of <a href="http://www.pegasusnews.com/news/2007/jul/19/fort-worth-isd-accepting-applications-substitute-t/?refscroll=609">$73 dollars per day</a>.&#160; Compare that to the average salary for an entry level developer, approximately $56K/year, and I believe you will agree that cultivating his interest into a marketable skill set should have an impact on his life.&#160; Chris has always had an interest in writing software, but it is hard to find time to go back to school while working.</p>  <p>As such, Chris and I have come to arrangement, one that is an experiment for me but which I firmly believe in.&#160; Effective today, January 9th 2011, Chris has begun an unpaid internship with my company TimRayburn.net LLC which puts on <a href="http://www.dallastechfest.com">Dallas TechFest</a> and other projects of mine.&#160; During the internship, he will be working with me to increase his basic skills in development, and learn how to craft software from the ground up.&#160; Initially, he will be working on assignments with little real-world application, but eventually he will be assisting me on actual projects that deliver real world value.&#160; As I’m sure some will be curious on how I have structured this plan, I will lay out at a high level what is involved:</p>  <ul>   <li>A commitment to dedicate time to the effort.&#160; Chris will be spending time with my at least three days a week for multiple hours. </li>    <li>A commitment from his spouse to support him in this effort.&#160; Chris is newly married, and his spouse needs to be on board if he is to have the support he will need at home. </li>    <li>A time boxed commitment, for us initially of six months.&#160; This will allow Chris to commit, while also knowing that it has an end point, and that if he chooses to continue than changes can occur at that time. </li>    <li>A penalty for not meeting the commitment.&#160; The details of which will not be public, but which are notable enough to impact his life should he decide to walk away from the commitment. </li>    <li>A reasonable third party arbiter, trusted by both myself and Chris who will be able to settle any disagreements around the penalty should that need arise.&#160; My wife Kate will be serving that role, which for Chris and I who have been friends for over 15 years is agreeable. </li> </ul>  <p>I do not know how this will go, but I am certain it will generate blog posts as I learn while I teach.&#160; Any suggestions?</p> <!-- BEGIN SALARY GRAPH --><link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://www.simplyhired.com/c/salary-common/styles/salary-graph-external.css" media="screen,print" />  <div class="SH_salary_graph">   <div class="SH_blue_box">     <div class="SH_bluetop">&#160;</div>      <div class="SH_blue_box_container">       <h3>Average Entry Level Developer Salaries in Arlington, TX</h3>        <table class="SH_bar_graph" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><colgroup><col class="SH_col_a1" /><col class="SH_col_a2" /><col class="SH_col_sep" /><col class="SH_col_b" /><col class="SH_col_c" /><col class="SH_col_d" /></colgroup><tfoot>           <tr>             <td class="SH_bar_graph_footer" colspan="2">In USD as of Jan 9, 2011</td>              <td></td>              <td colspan="3">               <table class="SH_salary_percent" width="100%"><tbody>                   <tr class="SH_salary_footer">                     <td><span>25k</span></td>                      <td><span>50k</span></td>                      <td><span>75k</span></td>                   </tr>                 </tbody></table>             </td>           </tr>         </tfoot><tbody>           <tr>             <td class="SH_salary_job_title">               <h4><a class="SH_job_title" href="http://www.simplyhired.com/a/jobs/list/q-entry+level+developer/l-arlington%2c+tx">entry level developer</a></h4>             </td>              <td class="SH_salary_amount"><span class="SH_salary">$56,000</span></td>              <td></td>              <td class="SH_salary_percent" colspan="3" align="left">               <div style="width: 75%" class="SH_bar"></div>             </td>           </tr>         </tbody></table>     </div> <!-- SH_blue_box_container -->      <div class="SH_bluebottom">&#160;</div>   </div> <!-- SH_blue_box --></div> <!-- SH_salary_graph -->  <div class="SH_salary_graph_footer">Find <a href="http://www.simplyhired.com/">Jobs</a> &amp;
