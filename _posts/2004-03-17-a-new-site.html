<p>Effective immediately, we have moved our web hosting at Tech Knights from ReadyHosting.Com to EAServe.Com</p><p>ReadyHosting quite frankly couldn't deliver real ASP.NET hosting.Â  They don't fully support .Text, and they also can't support DotNetNuke.</p><p>EAServe will do very well, and is the host of two local (Fort Worth and Plano) .NET Users Group.</p>
