<p>I've been a busy camper the last several months, having spoken at:</p> <ul> <li>Microsoft TechEd 2007 - Birds of a Feather : BizTalk, WCF and WF</li> <li>Little Rock .NET User Group - All Day Training Event : WCF Deep Dive</li> <li>Northwest Arkansas .NET User Group - Introduction to C# 3.0</li></ul> <p>But now there are several more coming up over the next several months I want to make you aware of:</p> <ul> <li>Oklahoma City Code Camp (<a href="http://www.okcodecamp.com">www.okcodecamp.com</a>) : Introduction to C# 3.0 on <strong>July 28th, 2007</strong></li> <li>Houston TechFest (<a href="http://www.houstontechfest.com">www.houstontechfest.com</a>) : Introduction to BizTalk Server and Introduction to C# 3.0 on <strong>August 25th, 2007</strong></li> <li>Memphis .NET User Group : Practical Test Driven Development on <strong>October 16th, 2007</strong></li> <li>Little Rock .NET User Group : Introduction to C# 3.0 on <strong>November 8th, 2007</strong></li> <li>VSLive! Austin : Introduction to C# 3.0 on <strong>November 13th, 2007</strong></li></ul> <p>In all likelihood I'll also be speaking at least twice at the Dallas BizTalk User Group between now and the end of the year as well.&nbsp; Looking like a busy season, and I look forward to meeting as many of you as I can while I'm out and about.</p> <p><strong>Memphis, take note :</strong> I'll be in Memphis the weekend before the user group, and it will be my birthday so if you've got recommendations of where I should go, or just tourist recommendations in general then drop a comment!&nbsp; This will be my first time in Memphis not going 50+ MPH the whole time.</p>
