<p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/2007/11/28/WeAreMicrosoftTeamSogeti.aspx">As I've mentioned before</a>, there is a big event coming up in January that has developers donating their time to benefit local charities.&nbsp; The event is called <a href="http://www.wearemicrosoft.com">We Are Microsoft</a> and is put on by Microsoft (care of Chris Koenig) and is being run by Toi Wright.&nbsp; I had a chance to catch up with Toi at the <a href="http://timrayburn.net/2007/11/28/VisualStudio2008InstallFest.aspx">Visual Studio 2008 InstallFest</a> last night, and ask her about the event.&nbsp; Here is that chat.</p> <p><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/D-YNwwJ2O84" width="425" height="350" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"> </embed></p>
