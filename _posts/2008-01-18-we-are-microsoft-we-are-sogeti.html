<p>The day has arrived, and it is time for the We Are Microsoft, Charity Challenge Weekend.&nbsp; My team, Team Sogeti, has been given the chance to help <a href="http://www.cityhouse.org/">City House</a> with an internal Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) portal.&nbsp; We've recruited some of the SharePoint brains within Sogeti, and I will be playing second fiddle to them and taking up the branding/skinning of the site.</p> <p>Our team, as it stands currently, consists of:</p> <ul> <li>Bryan</li> <li>Jason</li> <li>Gavin</li> <li>Deepak</li> <li>Tim (Me)</li></ul> <p>We'll have some part time support from Sogeti's uber-brain of SharePoint Tuc, and the occasional drop in from time to time this weekend from others.&nbsp; Of course worthy of note also is the support of my wife, Kate, who has agreed to "Team Mom" this wayward band, making sure they can stay focused by helping keep them in cokes/red bull/monster/etc.</p> <p>See everyone there later today, especially Improving and Telligent!</p>
