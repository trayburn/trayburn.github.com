<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig">Chris Koenig</a>, our Local Developer Evangelist has a big event coming up, here are some details:</p> <p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/VisualStudio2008InstallFest_80BD/Visual%20Studio%202008%20Pro%20Logo_2.png"><img style="border-top-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin: 10px; border-right-width: 0px" height="51" alt="Visual Studio 2008 Pro Logo" src="http://timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/VisualStudio2008InstallFest_80BD/Visual%20Studio%202008%20Pro%20Logo_thumb.png" width="240" align="left" border="0"></a> </p> <p>To celebrate the RTM of Visual Studio 2008, Microsoft is teaming up with some of the local area User Groups to throw a set of Holiday Party InstallFests.&nbsp; We've got 3 of them scheduled for South Central District:<ul> <li>Dec 3 – Tulsa (<a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032360634&amp;Culture=en-US">Registration Link</a>) with the Tulsa Developers User Group<li>Dec 5 – Dallas (<a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032360642&amp;Culture=en-US">Registration Link</a>) with the North Dallas .NET User Group<li>Dec 13 – Houston (<a href="http://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032360649&amp;Culture=en-US">Registration Link</a>) with the Houston .NET User Group </li></ul> <p>These holiday parties will feature food, drink, fun - including several Xbox 360s in HD with some of the latest games, fellowship and a chance to install the RTM bits of Visual Studio 2008 along with your friends! In fact, <strong>EVERYONE THAT REGISTERS FOR AND ATTENDS THE EVENT IN PERSON WILL RECEIVE A FREE COPY OF VISUAL STUDIO 2008 PROFESSIONAL IN THE MAIL ONCE IT'S AVAILABLE!</strong>&nbsp; As an added bonus - if you install Visual Studio 2008 on your computer during the event, we'll give you a free Visual Studio T-Shirt! So - no sneaky register-for-the-event-and-then-not-show-up action - you must be present to win :-)<p>Since we're giving away free product, we've had to put a cap on registrations - so register now and make sure you attend to get your free copy of Visual Studio 2008 Professional.&nbsp; If registrations are full, the waitlist should be enabled, so get on it.&nbsp; If you don't make it on the registration or waitlist list, don't fret - walk-ins are totally welcome, and we'd love to have you join us at the party!&nbsp; If there is any product left over after all the registered and wait-listed folks get theirs, you'll be next in line to get one :-)</p> <p><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong> <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; What version of Visual Studio will I get, and how will the free version upgrade work? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; You will be installing a copy of Visual Studio 2008 Professional Trial Edition at the event.&nbsp; This is a specially created 90-day evaluation of VS08Pro - it is NOT the same thing that is available today from Microsoft Downloads.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you receive your free copy of Visual Studio 2008 in the mail, you will be able to enter the product key from the packaging into VS08 and "unlock" it.&nbsp; The unlocking process will only work for the PRO trial edition that you get at the InstallFest - the version from Microsoft Downloads or MSDN will NOT be unlockable and will require an uninstall/re-install to get the proper version installed. <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Isn't Visual Studio 2008 RTM already publicly available?&nbsp; Why do I need to come to this party? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; Several reasons - first, the opportunity to have some fun over the holidays with your local user groups!&nbsp; Second, we are giving away FREE copies of Visual Studio 2008 Professional to registered attendees in the mail following the product launch.&nbsp; <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Do I have to bring my laptop to the event? <br>A: </strong> No, you don't. But - if you install the bits at the party, we'll give you a free T-shirt <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; What if I don't have a laptop - can I bring my Desktop?&nbsp; Will there be room/power? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Please do - we're looking for volunteers to bring their monitors + keyboards + mice to the event so that not everyone else needs to.&nbsp; If you're interested in helping us this way, please let me know. <p><strong>Q: Can I bring a friend? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; Absolutely!&nbsp; Bring 2!&nbsp; Just remember that you have to be registered, or on the wait list, for a chance to win free product. <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Does this InstallFest party cost anything to attend? <br>A: </strong> Nope - it's absolutely FREE to all attendees! <p><strong>Q:&nbsp; Does this replace the normal .NET User Group meeting in my city? <br>A:</strong>&nbsp; Yes - there aren't any plans to have additional meetings, but there will be plenty of .NET conversations going on around the party, I'm sure :-) <p><strong>Q: I can't go to this event - can I still get a free copy of Visual Studio 2008 somewhere else? <br>A:</strong> There are several other events coming up that will give you additional chances at getting free product including the next round of <a href="http://www.devcares.com">DevCares</a> events, the "official" product launch events starting at the end of February, and some post-release Community Launch events starting in March (more on that in a future post).</p>
