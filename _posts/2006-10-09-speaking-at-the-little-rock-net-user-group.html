<p>I've just confirmed I will be speaking at the <a href="http://www.lrdnug.org/">Little Rock .NET User Group</a> in <a href="http://www.lrdnug.org/Events/LRDNUGJanuaryMeeting/tabid/192/Default.aspx">January on Black Belt Xml</a>.&nbsp; If you're in the Little Rock area, please plan to attend, and if there is something you've always wanted to know about XML and the System.Xml namespace, drop me a line and let me know!</p>
