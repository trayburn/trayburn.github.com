<P>Today marks some major changes in my career.&nbsp; I've left my <A href="http://www.ghnonline.com">former employer GHN-Online </A>and started work as a contractor for <A href="http://www.hdvest.com">HD Vest</A>.&nbsp; The primary reason for this change is one of commute, as I live in far southern Arlington, TX and GHN's offices were located at I-635 &amp; Hwy. 75.&nbsp; For those of you not local to the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, that is a commute of an hour (without traffic) <STRONG>each way.</STRONG>&nbsp; The new location with HD Vest will bring back a minimum of an hour into each of my days, and possible quite a bit more than that on "rainy" or otherwise miserable days.</P><P>At the same time this change is happening, I am trying to focus more on moving Tech Knights to where I would like it to be.&nbsp; I will have a little more time and interest in getting it kicked off.&nbsp; I will also be getting even more involved with the local User Group community.&nbsp; Look for more information soon.</P>
