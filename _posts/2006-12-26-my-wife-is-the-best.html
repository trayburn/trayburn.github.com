<P><IMG src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/black-ipod-18.jpg" align=right border=0>My wife is simply the most wonderful creature on the planet, and not just because I got an 80GB Video iPod for Christmas. :)</P><P>I am not exactly the easiest person to buy for.&nbsp; I enjoy my gadgets, but I tend to supply myself with those on a regular basis.&nbsp; As such knowing just what to get me is very difficult.&nbsp; Recently I've been all torn up about what I wanted to do for a MP3 player, either an iPod or a Zune.</P><P>I love the concept behind the Zune, but despite the great potential of the hardware, the software for it just doesn't give me what I want.&nbsp; Wifi integrated, great!&nbsp; Download podcasts on the fly? Nope.&nbsp; Organize podcasts differently than music? Nope.&nbsp; Audible support? Nope.</P><P>The last of those, Audible.com support, was in the end the deal breaker on Zune.&nbsp; Audible.com is the best source for Audiobooks on the web and they have fabulous support across all sorts of MP3 players for their codecs and DRM scheme.&nbsp; Apple of course works very well with them, but the Zune doesn't.&nbsp; Why? Got me, my PocketPC can play Audible books, it can even download them directly using the data link.&nbsp; But Zune can't even play them.</P><P>I've had the iPod for about 24 hours and I can say, I am beginning to understand what all the fuss is about.&nbsp; First of all it feels more solid and well manufactured than any device I've ever owned.&nbsp; The user interface is well organized and intuitive.&nbsp; And then there are the little things, like how it auto-pauses when the headphones are unplugged.&nbsp; How it came fully charged and ready to run.&nbsp; And the fabulous iTunes Store which has tons of free podcasts listed, including several I've never heard of before despite being an avid listener of them.</P><P>So consider this post my thumbs up for the iPod and yet another thank you to my beautiful wife for getting me such a great gift.</P>
