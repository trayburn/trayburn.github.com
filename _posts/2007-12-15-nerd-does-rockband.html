<p>Whenever a bunch of Microsoft-type geeks gather to have fun, Chris Koenig is sure to pull out some XBox 360s and games for folks to enjoy.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ddnug.net">Dallas .NET User Group's Casino Night</a> was no exception.&nbsp; The difference was that in this case the game of the night was Rockband, and Chris could hardly be pulled away from the game to receive the recognition the group gave him for being such a great Developer Evangelist and User Group supporter.&nbsp; In tribute to this, I give you a montage of Chris playing Rockband, set to <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/2006/04/14/thing-a-week-29-code-monkey">Jonathan Coulton's wonderful Code Monkey</a>.</p> <p><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZoAR1mofs6s&amp;rel=1" width="425" height="355" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent"></embed></p>
