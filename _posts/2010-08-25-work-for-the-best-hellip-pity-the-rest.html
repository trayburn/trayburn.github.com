<p>Do you work for a company that truly, I mean truly, values technical leadership and skills?&#160; Do they value your abilities to communicate with non-IT staff?&#160; Do they encourage you to get involved in the community through a bonus compensation plan that includes things as simple as <strong>attending</strong> a local user group?&#160; No?&#160; Then perhaps its time to Improve your outlook…</p>  <p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/WorkfortheBestPitytheRest_9268/Improving%20Logo_2.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="Improving Logo" border="0" alt="Improving Logo" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/WorkfortheBestPitytheRest_9268/Improving%20Logo_thumb.jpg" width="240" height="86" /></a> </p>  <p>Improving Enterprises, my employer since March of 2009, is just such and employer.&#160; Improving has to be doing something right, after all we’ve just been named to the Inc. 500/5000 list, placing us at #210 in the nation, but number #10 fastest growing company in Dallas, and #18 in IT Services nationwide.&#160; And this is our second year on that list.</p>  <p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/WorkfortheBestPitytheRest_9268/inc5000_2010_logo_2.gif"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="inc5000_2010_logo" border="0" alt="inc5000_2010_logo" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/WorkfortheBestPitytheRest_9268/inc5000_2010_logo_thumb.gif" width="240" height="32" /></a> </p>  <p>Now why am I telling you all of this?&#160; Is it just to brag about how great my life at Improving is?&#160; To rub in your face that I get to work for a company with 4 Microsoft MVPs on staff?&#160; No, none of that…</p>  <p><strong>It’s because we’re hiring … and in a big way!</strong></p>  <p>How big?&#160; We’ve got over 20 positions open at the current time.&#160; Are we just looking for rock stars?&#160; Not at all … we’ve got positions available at Consultant, Senior Consultant, and Principal Consultant available.&#160; Consultants are generally people just out of school, or with a year or two of experience, and it goes up from there.</p>  <p><strong>Why should you work for us?</strong></p>  <p>For me, it is just this simple : I like to be challenged at work, I want to feel that my co-workers are challenging me to expand my horizons.&#160; I’ve felt that way every day since I started at Improving.</p>  <p>Other perks?&#160; How about an annual company retreat to Vegas.&#160; A bonus plan.&#160; And an incredible work environment.</p>  <p><strong>CALL TO ACTION – It’s time to work for the best, and pity the rest … if you’re interested in working for an incredible organization like Improving, then drop me an email with your resume to <a href="mailto:Tim@TimRayburn.net">Tim@TimRayburn.net</a> and we’ll get you started along the process.</strong></p>
