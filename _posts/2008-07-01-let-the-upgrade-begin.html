<p>So I know at least some of my friends will be pleased to hear that I've completed my upgrade to Graffiti CMS, migrating from dasBlog.&nbsp; I must say that dasBlog has served me very well, but as the blog has grown in popularity, I've done screencasts, and other things I've begun to realize that I truly needed a CMS, not just a blog.&nbsp; The blog will remain a major feature of TimRayburn.net and the existing feed url will continue to retrieve only my blog content, but I've now got room to grow.</p>
