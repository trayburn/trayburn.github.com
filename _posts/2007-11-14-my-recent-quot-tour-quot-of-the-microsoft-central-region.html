<p><img id="id" src="https://partner.microsoft.com/binary/US/40046689"></p> <p>My friend <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig/archive/2007/11/09/microsoft-central-region-who-and-where-are-you.aspx">Chris Koenig&nbsp;recently put up a post called "Microsoft Central Region - Who (and where) are you?"</a> in which he shared the above image which I thought was worth re-sharing here.&nbsp; So what does this image show?&nbsp; It shows the "sub areas" within Microsoft's Central Region where the Evangelism teams focus.&nbsp; Chris, our Developer Evangelist from Dallas, covers Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana.&nbsp; Recently they've added some help for him in the geographically vast area via J Sawyer based in Houston.&nbsp; Both Houston and Dallas are huge markets for Microsoft and as such having a DE based in each of these cities will help run Chris a little less ragged.</p> <p>Now, many of my readers are based in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, and we're spoiled because we <strong>see</strong> Chris on a regular basis because he is based here.&nbsp; But it is important to remember that he's just as responsible for the Little Rock, or Northwest Arkansas groups (not to mention Lubbock group) as he is for those in D/FW.</p> <p>I was reviewing this map and realized that in the last several week's I've hit most of these areas, in fact all but the "Midwest Area".&nbsp; I've covered:</p> <ul> <li>North Central</li> <ul> <li>Minneapolis BizTalk 2006 R2 Launch</li> <li>Heartland Developer Conference</li></ul> <li>Heartland Area</li> <ul> <li>Memphis Day of .NET</li></ul> <li>South Central</li> <ul> <li>Little Rock .NET User Group</li> <li>VSLive! Austin</li> <li>Houston BizTalk 2006 R2 Launch</li></ul></ul> <p>Here is what I can tell you after all traveling:</p> <ul> <li>My favorite Marriott hotel chain is the Fairfield Inn chain.&nbsp; Good breakfast (unlike Courtyards) and bright, happy rooms.</li> <li>My wife believes I've forgotten how to get home.</li> <li>My boss believes I've forgotten I'm a billable consultant.</li> <li>I believe that I'm seriously looking forward to vacation next week.</li></ul>
