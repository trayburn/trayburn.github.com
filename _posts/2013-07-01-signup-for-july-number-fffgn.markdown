I'm pleased to report that our first Fourth Friday Family Game Night (#FFFGN) was an incredible success.  We had over 30 players, playing an assortment of games from Phase 10 to Dominion to Ticket to Ride Europe, and more.

We've opened sign ups for our next event, which will be July 26th, starting at 6pm until we get tired and go home.  You can signup at:

# [fffgn.eventbrite.com](http://fffgn.eventbrite.com)

We look forward to seeing even more of you at the July gathering.  Again, in case you're not familiar with the event, [you can find the details here](/fffgn), but it is open to ANYONE.  This last month we had someone show up who had just met an attendee in their apartment parking lot when they saw them carrying out a copy of Dominion. ANYONE is invited.
