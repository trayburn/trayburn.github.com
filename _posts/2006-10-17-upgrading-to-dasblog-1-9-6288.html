<p>It is a rule of the universe that building a better mouse trap just inspires smarter mice.&nbsp; That said it still is necessary to build such traps just to get some peace between iterations of mice.</p> <p><a href="http://www.winterdom.com/weblog/2006/10/11/NoTrackbacksForYou.aspx">I had</a> <a href="http://www.aniltj.com/blog/2006/10/07/TurningOffTrackbacksAndPingbacks.aspx">noticed</a> <a href="http://www.mohundro.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,10eb4b00-b733-47c4-996d-662d88663681.aspx">lots of</a> <a href="http://www.masteringbiztalk.com/blogs/jon/PermaLink,guid,016884c9-e0fb-429f-aacb-6835e771f6fa.aspx">people</a> turning of trackbacks and pingbacks in dasBlog 1.9 because of spam entering from these channels.&nbsp; I even consulted with the guys at <a href="http://www.edsquared.com">EdSquared.com</a> who just had their blog attacked in such a way.&nbsp; I happened to be <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/">reading Scoble</a> and he mentioned <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/10/16/automattics-ceo-toni-schneider-on-scobleshow/">Wordpress' sister company Akismet</a>.&nbsp; <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> is a comment spam and trackback spam blocking service which is free to individuals.</p> <p>Of course I said, "Great! Now all I have to do is implement this in dasBlog..." but then my lazy programmer kicked in and I said, "Hey maybe I should search and see if someone else has first."&nbsp; <a href="http://flimflan.com/blog/Trackback.aspx?guid=74b47ae6-45aa-43be-b719-652be662703c">Enter Joshua Flanagan</a>.&nbsp; He had the same thought, but he was already on the dasBlog team and has committed the change to the current codebase.&nbsp; Add to this that <a href="http://dasblog.info/dbftp/">dasBlog is now running nightly builds</a> and you've got the makings of an upgrade.</p> <p>I sincerely that the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/">dasBlog</a> <a href="http://www.shahine.com/omar/">leadership</a> will hear the outcry from those linked above and release 1.9.1 as quickly as possible to make this feature more widely available.&nbsp; Especially since because of this flaw none of the people I linked to above will be automatically informed of this post and a possible solution.</p>
