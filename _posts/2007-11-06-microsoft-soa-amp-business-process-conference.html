<p>For those who attended my session on BizTalk Server 2006 R2 and HIPAA Transactions at the Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference you can <a href="http://TimRayburn.net/content/binary/SOAConference2007.zip">download the slides now from this site</a>.&nbsp; Conference attendees will also eventually have access to a recording of the session but that may be weeks in the comings.</p>
