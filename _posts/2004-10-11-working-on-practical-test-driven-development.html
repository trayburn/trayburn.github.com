<p>I'm working on the final classes for a Brown Bag lunch I'll be giving to the development teams at GHN sometime soon.  Its entitled “Practical Test Driven Development” and is focused on actually putting NUnit to use in the development of projects.  How to reorganize your development cycle, the benefits, and time involved, etc.  I'll probably post the slides here sometime soon.</p>
