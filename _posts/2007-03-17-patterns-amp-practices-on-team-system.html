<p>The Patterns &amp; Practices division over at Microsoft is starting a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=VSTSGuidance">Wiki on Team System</a> best practices and guidance and they're using CodePlex to do it.&nbsp; If your thing is Team System this is a great way to interact with the team by both learning and offering suggestions in their discussion area.
