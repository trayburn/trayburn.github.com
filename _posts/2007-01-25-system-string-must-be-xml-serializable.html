<p>Several people have begun to encounter a problem compiling projects after installing BizTalk Server 2004 SP2.&nbsp; Fortunately this problem has been encountered before and there is a Windows HotFix which solves it.&nbsp; Despite the name, this fix will work for SP2 just as well as SP1.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/28610174/re-is-biztalk-2004-sp2-s.aspx">You can find it here.</a></p>
