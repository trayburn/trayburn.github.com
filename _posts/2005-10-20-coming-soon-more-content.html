<P>I will be putting the blog through a major overhaul in the very near future.&nbsp; It will inclue:</P><UL><LI>Slide Decks for several of my presentations</LI><LI>Project page for a set of CodeSmith templates which use the Enterprise Library 2.0 CTP and Visual C# 2.0 to generate a data layer.&nbsp; This first version will only use the DAAB (Data Access Application Block) but I expect to extend it in the near future to include use of the Logging &amp; Instrumentation Block and the Exception Handling Block at a minimum.&nbsp; I also have some interesting ideas for how to use the Security Application Block down the road.</LI><LI>Possibly an upgrade to version 1.2 of Community Server, that depends on how they're development proceeds.</LI></UL><P>&nbsp;</P>
