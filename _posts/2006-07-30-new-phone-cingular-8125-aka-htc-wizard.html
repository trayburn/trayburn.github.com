<IMG height=450 alt=Cingular8125.bmp src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/Cingular8125.bmp" width=315 align=right border=0> The time has come to retire my faithful Audiovox SMT-5600, it has served me dutifully for the last several years but since I am now a <A href="http://www.cingular.com/">Cingular</A> customer, the quality of service on Cingular's network compared to AT&amp;T Wireless' network left much to be desired. I reviewed my options, including the concept of becoming a Verizon customer and getting a Treo 700w, and finally settled on staying with Cingular and taking the Cingular 8125 aka HTC Wizard. <BR><BR>So far I'm loving the increased usability that comes with the full QWERTY keyboard and Pocket PC Phone Edition OS. I will say that, like all Pocket PC Phone Edition devices, this is a Pocket PC first, Phone second. The dialing interface leaves alot to be desired but the flexibility of programs and data-entry makes up for that to me. <BR><BR>Of course the first thing I did was installed the Compact Framework 2.0 so I could port over several wonderful helper programs I've written like TKRoller (simple dice roller, now empowered by a touch screen). Also I've upgraded the Tablet to run <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/beta/getthebeta.mspx">Office 2007 Beta 2</A> (more on that later) so it was also nice to be able to install OneNote Mobile 2007. I've also downloaded several wonderful programs for it including <A href="http://www.pocketinformant.com/">Informant 2005</A>, <A href="http://www.audible.com/">Audible Player</A>, <A href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;rls=GGLJ,GGLJ:2006-25,GGLJ:en&amp;q=Audible+Air">Audible Air</A>, and <A href="http://www.astraware.com/ppc/puzzle/atomica/?skucode=0022-000-0043">Atomica</A> . <BR><BR>I've gotten Bluetooth Sync to work with the tablet (I never did get this working with the 5600) and it can be easily used as a USB Modem for the tablet for those times when a network connection with un-filtered access is hard to come by. <BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
