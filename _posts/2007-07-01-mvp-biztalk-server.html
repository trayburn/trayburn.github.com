<P><IMG style="FLOAT: right" height=173 alt=mvplogo.png src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/mvplogo.png" width=110 border=0>I've been visiting Arkansas this weekend, but while reviewing my spam folder I noticed something got caught that shouldn't have.&nbsp; Specifically the email that informed me I've been selected as an MVP for BizTalk Server.&nbsp; I'm honored, and appreciate the support of everyone who has made this possible by opening their groups to me to speak.</P>
