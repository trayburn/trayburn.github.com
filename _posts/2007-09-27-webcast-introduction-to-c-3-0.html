<p>I've spent some time today recording my first of what I hope to be several webcasts.&nbsp; These webcasts are made possible through the generation gift of a <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp">Camtasia</a> license from <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">TechSmith</a>.&nbsp; I've been a fan of <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp">Camtasia</a> for many years, and the latest versions are a joy to work with.</p>
