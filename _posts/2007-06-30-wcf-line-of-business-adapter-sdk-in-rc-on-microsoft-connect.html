<p>Sonu Arora, who I had the pleasure of meeting at TechEd this year, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/sonuarora/archive/2007/06/28/getting-ready-to-ship-a-public-beta.aspx">has just posted on her blog</a> that her team has released an RC (Release Candidate) of the WCF Line of Business Adapter SDK to <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/Downloads/DownloadDetails.aspx?SiteID=65&amp;DownloadID=7390">Microsoft Connect</a>.&nbsp; In case you don't know, this is the framework upon which Microsoft is building their next generation adapters to systems such as Siebel, SAP, and Oracle Financials.&nbsp; It is based around extracting meta-data from the LOB application, and works entirely consistently with the WCF channel extensibility model.</p> <p>If you read my blog and do BizTalk, and even more relevantly do BizTalk and SAP, Siebel, Oracle Financials or other LOB applications, then you'll want to look at this.&nbsp; Post R2 this would be the recommended route to take if you had a LOB application you needed to integrate with, rather than writing a Custom Adapter.&nbsp; You'd simply write an LOB Adapter in .NET using this SDK, and then implement with the WCF Adapter for BizTalk.&nbsp; The benefit there is that the work in the Adapter would be re-usable to other WCF .NET applications and not tied exclusively to the BizTalk object model.</p>
