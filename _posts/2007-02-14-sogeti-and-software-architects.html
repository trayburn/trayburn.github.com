<P>As you likely know if you read this blog, I'm employed by <A href="http://us.sogeti.com">Sogeti</A> as a Principal Consultant.&nbsp; I'm part of the Microsoft Practice and focus on BizTalk and overall "Connected Systems" architecture.&nbsp; Living in the Dallas area, the name I most often hear after "BizTalk" from a clients mouth is "SARK".</P><P>"<A href="http://www.sark.com">SARK</A>" or Software Architects as they are properly named is a 500+ employee consulting firm with a large Dallas area contingent.&nbsp; They have alot of BizTalk brain-trust working for them.&nbsp; I've worked with some of their consultants for a short time at CitiFinancial Auto when I was an independent and was impressed.&nbsp; I've said before that if I ever were to leave Sogeti that SARK would be high on my list of companies I'd like to work for.</P><P>Well I was thrilled the other day to hear the <A href="http://home.businesswire.com/portal/site/google/index.jsp?ndmViewId=news_view&amp;newsId=20070207006470&amp;newsLang=en">announcement</A> that Sogeti has purchased Software Architects!&nbsp; This is nothing but incredible for everyone involved, it brings the Microsoft Practice in Texas alone to over 300 consultants.&nbsp; I'm thrilled to have the guys I know from SARK join the Sogeti family.&nbsp; </P><P>So <A href="http://dallas.sark.com/SarkBlog/mholdorf/Default.aspx">Mike</A>, <A href="http://dallas.sark.com/SarkBlog/jmsummers/Default.aspx">Jonathan</A>, and <A href="http://www.flux88.com/">Ben</A> welcome!</P>
