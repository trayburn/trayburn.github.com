<p>About 30 days ago I began the process of installing a Windows Home Server in my house.&nbsp; After what is now referred to as the "Great Hard Drive Crash of April 2007" by my wife, it was clear to me that I needed to address the data recovery/disaster recovery plan for my house a little bit more in depth, a Home Server was my second step, the first was Mozy but that's another post.</p> <p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsHomeServer_18A9/Windows%20Home%20Server.jpg" atomicselection="true"><img style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" alt="Windows Home Server" src="http://timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/WindowsHomeServer_18A9/Windows%20Home%20Server_thumb.jpg" align="left" border="0"></a> </p> <p>The "Windows Home Server" operating system is currently only available OEM to System Builders or via online resellers which resell such OEM products.&nbsp; Creating a Home Server was both no problem what so ever, and obviously System Builder material at the same time.&nbsp; The OS install reboots multiple times, identifies itself as Windows Small Business Server 2003 for portions of it, and otherwise is not "polished" for retail delivery.</p> <p>On the other hand, the experience once it is installed is fantastic.&nbsp; This software has many useful features, but the big one for us was the dynamic storage system.&nbsp; You can create a virtual storage system from many smaller drives which have no restrictions on them, they can be any size, speed, interface, etc you happen to have.</p> <p>In my case the first portion of storage was the remainder of my boot drive, which the system automatically partitioned and handed over the largest segment of (all but 30gb) to storage.&nbsp; Then I added 2 USB hard drives.&nbsp; A few weeks later, after some traveling, I added another drive from a system I was no longer using bringing the total storage to 0.98 TB, not bad.&nbsp; Well during the recent Black Friday sales here in the US I picked up a new 1TB My Book from Western Digital, installed that and brought the server to 1.98 TB.</p> <p>It was this upgrade that made me write this post.&nbsp; I was anxious, I did the upgrade in the middle of the night while several people in my house were watching videos from the Home Server.&nbsp; I had to add a USB hub, so I had to unplug one of the drives in the array.&nbsp; Instantly every box on the network was notified of a drive failure on the Home Server, but despite that there was no interruption of either video stream that was running.&nbsp; I then plugged in the drives, added the additional storage, and started pulling a video file myself to take the load to 3 simultaneous video feeds.&nbsp; There was a touch of slowness during the next 5 minutes as the server sought to balance the storage, but nothing horrible.&nbsp; My house has 4 laptops, 3 desktops and a the home server currently and I must say that it handles this admirably.</p> <p>My only gripe?&nbsp; They need a 64 bit version of the Home Server client software.&nbsp; I'm aware of the hacks to get this installed, but it doesn't get the backups running and that is key.</p>
