<div class="Section1"> <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I’m happy to announce that I am once again among the gainfully employed, working as the Senior Software Architect for Global Healthnet, Inc.  The interview process was quite the blitz, as they had an immediate need to employ someone with BizTalk and Visual Studio.NET experience to knowledge transfer from the departing Developer.  It’s going to be a bit of an uphill battle at first, learning all of the existing systems and training the rest of the departments, which are all still being hired.  They have subsisted on one developer for some time, and now are hiring a couple of developers, with an eye towards more in the near term.</span></font></p> <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">I’ve begun to put together my “Best Practices and Patterns” document, so that at least the next-generation system which is going to be my primary task will be developed using some sort of guidelines.  There may not be an immense need now, but if we see the spurt of growth we are supposed to in a few of months, then I’d rather have these set in place now, then try and fit them in later.</span></font></p> <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></font></p></div>
