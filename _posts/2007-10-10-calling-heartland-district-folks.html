<p>Alright, so next week is shaping up a bunch of fun.&nbsp; I'm wrapping up a BizTalk 2006 R2/Visual Studio 2008 project this week and next week I'm headed to Minneapolis and Omaha for a couple of speaking engagements!</p> <p>Tuesday I'll be in Minneapolis, speaking at the BizTalk 2006 R2 launch event care of my employer Sogeti.&nbsp; I'll be speaking about RFID and EDI in two different sessions.</p> <p>By Thursday I have to make the run down to Omaha to speak at the Heartland Developer Conference where I'm stepping in to cover a Test Driven Development talk for a speaker who had to bow out at the last minute.</p> <p>I fly in to Minneapolis on Monday, out on Saturday, and so this a call out to anyone in that area to see if we want to get something together.&nbsp; Geek Dinner?&nbsp; Drinks at a pub? Pretty much anything.</p> <p>Of course, you can also touch base if you'd like to do something more productive.&nbsp; I'd be more than happy to do some visits to development shops, slip in an architectural or code review, talk to your team about BizTalk, C# 3.0, or pretty much anything.&nbsp; So let's hear it, Heartland District, shout out if you'd like to hook up.</p>
