Alright, so it's a bit of boasting on myself but I'm happy to say that officially as of yesterday I've been added as a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/memberlist.php?group_id=10749">Developer</a> on <a href="http://www.nunit.org">NUnit</a>.If you know me, you know I believe firmly in Test Driven Development and I've been contributing for some time now to the NUnit project.Well <a href="http://www.nunit.com/blogs/">Charlie Pool</a> extended the offer and I've accepted the position to become a Developer on the project officially.What does it change?Very little, I'll still be writing code for this great tool just like I was before this but it does make me feel like my contributions to the project have been of a high quality and that people appreciate the time I've dedicated to it.
