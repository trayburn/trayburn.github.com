title: "Cannot call the EDISend Pipeline from an Orchestration"

<p>I'm quite certain I won't be the only person who tries this, I had a need to send an encoded EDI message to a Web Service, so I was like "No problem, we're in the high tech land of BizTalk 2006 R2 now, I'll just call a Pipeline directly from an Orchestration, get the results and send that along."</p> <p>Not so quick, buck-o replied BizTalk, and after some Googleing I came up <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=1555953&amp;SiteID=1">with this link</a> to a post on the Microsoft forums which informed me that you can't do that.&nbsp; Specifically, to quote it here in case that forum thread disappears, the question was "Steven G." and asked (in part) :</p> <blockquote> <p>I have an orchestration which is trying to send EDI files using a dynamic send port. <p>I have been trying, with no success, to call the "Microsoft.BizTalk.Edi.DefaultPipelines.EdiSend" from within my orchestration, as follows:</p></blockquote> <p>And the response can back from Tony Bernard of Microsoft: <blockquote> <p>Running the EDISend pipeline from an orchestration is not supported in R2.&nbsp; We are tracking this for the future, but had higher priority items to address for this release. <p>I would suggest one of two approaches:<ul> <li> <p>a post-processing pipeline component which performs the manipulation that you need to occur after serialization</p> <li> <p>using a loopback port. Basically, use a send port with that pipeline into an MSMQ or file location and a receive location with a pass through pipeline back into the orchestration </p></li></ul></blockquote> <p>So no love there.&nbsp; I ended up working around the problem, but know I will have to solve this again in a few days, so be looking for a post from me on how to implement the Loopback port which Tony suggested.</p>
