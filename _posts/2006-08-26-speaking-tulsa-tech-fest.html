This looks to be a fantastic event with the very best from around the US attending, including Carl Franklin from .NET Rocks, Ron Jacobs from Microsoft's Patterns and Practices Group, and many others.</P><P><A href="http://www.sogeti.com">Sogeti</A> will be there in force, with Ed Kissinger and Ed Blankenship of <A href="http://www.edsquared.com">EdSquared.com</A> presenting two sessions on Team Foundation Server and VSTS.&nbsp; I will be presenting two talks, one on Zero Cost .NET, a demonstration of how Microsoft's products can realistically compete with the LAMP offering, and a second presentation on NUnit Extensibility.</P><P>I'm particularly excited about the Zero Cost .NET presentation, which I've been working on gathering the resources for and which should have a block-buster closer demonstration.&nbsp; I hope you can find time to come out and check out what Tulsa Tech Fest has to offer.</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P>
