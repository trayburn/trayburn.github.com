<p>I love the Dallas/Fort Worth developer community, I've got friends who work for all sorts of companies around the metroplex.&nbsp; Of course, as a consultant myself some of the best and brightest in the area unfortunately work for other firms.&nbsp; Two of the biggest hoarders of .NET Talent in D/FW are <a href="http://www.improvingenterprises.com">Improving Enterprises</a> and of course, <a href="http://www.telligent.com">Telligent</a>.&nbsp; As you all know I'm a little passionate about the <a href="http://www.wearemicrosoft.com">We Are Microsoft</a> event, so I decided to take some time after the InstallFest the other day and call out Improving Enterprises and Telligent on camera, this is what ensued.</p> <p><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1EcT97e4AsU&amp;rel=1" width="425" height="355" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent"></p> <p>So you've heard it, both Improving Enterprises and Telligent will be there.&nbsp; If your a Telligent employee and interested, I'd suggest contacting <a href="http://jay.leask.com/">Jay Leask</a> and if you're an Improving Enterprises employee I suggest <a href="http://www.improvingenterprises.com">Caleb Jenkins</a>.</p> <p>Many thanks to <a href="http://www.addressof.com">Cory Smith</a> and <a href="http://blog.davidohara.net/">Dave O'Hara</a> for working the camera for me so I could call people out properly on camera myself.</p></embed>
