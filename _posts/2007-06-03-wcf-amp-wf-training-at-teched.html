<p>So I'm wiped.... my first day of TechEd behind me and Party with Palermo complete.</p> <p>It was a great day, particularly the Pre-Conference training I attended by Jon Flanders of Pluralsight and Richard B. of DevelopMentor.</p> <p>I learned quite a bit, I already had alot of the basics down, but the more advanced look into what WF could do was great.&nbsp; In particular I hadn't learned anything about Dynamic Change or custom services prior to this class.</p> <p>Jon and Richard did a great job, and I'm glad I've planned to attend most of Jon's session for the rest of the week.</p>
