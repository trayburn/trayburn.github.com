<p>Absolutely incredible trip thus far!&nbsp; It's been great meeting and hanging out with people in the Heartland District and I wanted to share the slide decks from my talks.</p> <p>At the Minneapolis BizTalk 2006 R2 launch I talked about BizTalk 2006 R2 and EDI, and BizTalk 2006 R2 and RFID.&nbsp; <a href="http://TimRayburn.net/content/binary/MplsR2Launch.zip">The decks can be found here.</a></p> <p>At the Heartland Developer Conference I had a packed house of over 100 people to learn about Practical Test Driven Development, and <a href="http://TimRayburn.net/content/binary/PracticalTDD.zip">those slides can be found here.</a>&nbsp; I hope I'm invited back to HDC next year, the difference between it and the (also fun) Tulsa TechFest was absolutely stunning.&nbsp; Very tight, 4 tracks, but great attendance at talks.&nbsp; Love it.&nbsp; Kudos to Joe and Phil.</p>
