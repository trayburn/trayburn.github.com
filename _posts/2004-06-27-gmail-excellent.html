<P>With much thanks to <A href="http://www.datagridgirl.com">DataGridGirl </A>for sending me an invitation, I now have a <A href="http://www.gmail.com">GMail </A>account which I will be using for my various mailing lists and other purposes.</P><P>My first read on the interface is that I absolutely love the threading and labeling features.&nbsp; I knew GMail would be a fit after I heard the system described because I am a fanatic user of search folders in Outlook 2003, so a mail system powered by the finest search engine in the world was a sure thing.</P><P>If you haven't checked out Marcie's blog, you really should.</P>
