<p>I’ve been invited to speak tonight at the <a href="http://sug.dotnetprogramming.com/">Spokane .NET Users Group</a> and I’ll be talking about Heresy with MongoDB.</p>  <blockquote>   <p>In the back of most developers minds, lingering in their subconscious and waiting to pounce when they least expect it is the nagging concept that not every system in the world is an ideal fit for the structured life of a relational database. Join Microsoft MVP, Tim Rayburn as he reviews MongoDB, a document database, its concepts, ideas and the drivers available to the .NET developer for using this project. Come learn how you may never again have to separate OrderLines from Orders just to make a database happy – and similar approaches used by the likes of Amazon and Google (just to name a few).</p></blockquote>
