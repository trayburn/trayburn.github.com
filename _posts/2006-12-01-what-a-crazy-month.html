<p>So what does it take to get me from blogging every day to not blogging for a month?&nbsp; Quite alot actually!</p> <ul> <li>Major Product Release : What started it all without a doubt was the release at the end of October of a major update to my client's software.&nbsp; It meant alot of crazy hours to make that happen.</li> <li>Problems with the Release : This was followed on by a wide variety of problems with the production release, some related to code, many more related to humans.&nbsp; That resulted in 50-60 hours weeks for a month.</li> <li>Trip to South Dakota : I had the pleasure to visit a client's site in South Dakota and give 3 days of training on Service Oriented Architecture to some very bright folks.&nbsp; The trip went well but preparing my slides for that and then presenting those at the client's site took yet more time.</li></ul> <p>All that said I'm back and will be posting much more regularly.&nbsp; There are some major problems with the CustomFunctoids that need to be addressed thanks to a commenter for pointing that out.&nbsp; There is work to be done on the BizTalk Users Group and more.</p>
