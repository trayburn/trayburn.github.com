<p>I'm working on a document which will eventually be published here on best practices for BizTalk development.&nbsp; What practices do you insist on in your project?</p> <ul> <li>Naming?&nbsp; I generally use Scott Colestock's guidelines for this.<li>Backdoor Receive Locations? Any rules on putting in re-entry points for non-file adapters?<li>Mapping?&nbsp; Any rules about how things will be organized, laid-out, etc?<li>Anything else?</li></ul> <p>Post your comments here, I'd love to hear people's ideas on this subject.</p>
