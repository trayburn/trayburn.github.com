<p><strong>UPDATE : Dallas TechFest has been scheduled and the website can be found at <a href="http://DallasTechFest.com">http://DallasTechFest.com</a> </strong></p>  <p>Last year TimRayburn.net LLC was formed to take on the project of putting on Dallas TechFest 2008, with the full intention of putting then on for years to come.&#160; My original plans had been to put on the next Dallas TechFest during March of this year, but given several things, some avoidable some not, that is not going to be workable.&#160; The harshest reality is that with the current economy, finding sponsors willing to support the event is much harder.&#160; I have high hopes that a 2009 event may still be doable, but it will not be doable in March.</p>
