In case you are not aware, Sogeti is a division of Capgemini which focuses on regional IT services delivery.&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; It means our consultants don't travel (for the most part) and are placed at positions within their home cities.&nbsp; </p> <p>We have at Sogeti one of the best work/life balance benefit packages I've ever encountered in the industry, here are some details:</p> <ul> <li>All full-time employee consultants are salaried, W2 employees.&nbsp; We are a consultancy, not a contracting body shop.&nbsp; Rolling off a project with a client results in bench time at the office while sales places you at the next client, not the end of your time at Sogeti.</li> <li>Medical and Dental Insurance paid for the consultant, plus the option of a Health Savings Account which allows you to save money towards any sort of "out of pocket" medical expenses, even over the counter drugs, with pre-tax dollars.&nbsp; If you don't use the money, it rolls over year to year, and becomes yours to do with as you wish at retirement age.</li> <li>Comp-Time for every billable hour over 40 worked in a week.&nbsp; We've all had that nasty 60 hour a week project, they for the most part cannot be avoided, but with this plan you would earn 20 hours of Comp-Time per week to use to spend time with your family when work was less crazy.&nbsp; They reward time with time, not money, and that is key.</li> <li>Three weeks of PTO for the first two years, four weeks after that (it goes up again but I forget when).&nbsp; Also twice per year you can purchase a week of PTO, meaning you could have as much as 5 weeks of PTO in your first year and that is not factoring in Comp-Time.</li></ul> <p>What sort of folks are we looking for you ask?&nbsp; .NET Developers of all levels but if you have experience with any of the following technologies that would definitely help:</p> <ul> <li>BizTalk Server - We've got the premiere BizTalk practice in the area and would love to welcome more talented developers into the fold.</li> <li>Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server 2007 aka MOSS 2007 - A hot technology at the moment and <strong>the</strong> emerging enterprise web technology.&nbsp; If you've work with Sharepoint, drop me a line.</li></ul> <p>So are you interested?&nbsp; Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:Tim@TimRayburn.net">Tim@TimRayburn.net</a> with your resume attached and I'll get you in touch with the right people to start the process.&nbsp; Remember, life is to short to do something you don't enjoy completely.</p>
