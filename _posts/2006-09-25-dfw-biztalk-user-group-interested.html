<p>I've been having conversations with several people working with BizTalk in the DFW area recently and we are trying to guage interest in the forming of a BizTalk User Group.&nbsp; To start with we would probably begin as a Special Interest Group (SIG) of the Dallas .NET User Group.&nbsp; I've had preliminary conversations with their President and he is amiable to the idea.&nbsp; What I need to know is who out there would like to be a member of such an organization?</p> <p>If you are interested, drop me an email using the contact link on my blog and let me know or leave a comment here.</p>
