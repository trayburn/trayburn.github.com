<p>If you've been trying to find me amidst the crowd of people at TechEd and haven't succeeded, then stop by the Sogeti table in the Partner Expo today between 11:30am and 1:00pm when I will be manning the booth and talking about Vista Impact Training and nearly anything else people would like to talk about.&nbsp; Of course if no one asks me anything, then I'll talk about what I like to talk about ... BizTalk.</p>
