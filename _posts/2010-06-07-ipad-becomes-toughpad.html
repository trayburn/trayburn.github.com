<p>So on Thursday afternoon, I picked up a beautiful new iPad 16gb WiFi.&#160; As an avid iPhone user, I find the device to be everything I expected, and used it all day Friday happily.</p>  <p>On Saturday night, technically Sunday morning, I was leaving the home of my brother after a night of playing poker, and drove out of his driveway with the iPad on the roof of my Suburban.&#160; My drive was 5 minutes of city streets, and somewhere along the way, on a road I was going about 30 miles per hour on, my iPad took the plunge.&#160; Now, of course, I didn’t notice this at the time.&#160; So it fell into the roadway and I drove on.&#160; When I finally realized it was missing when I got home, I called my brother who went out from his place, we met in the middle and he found it in the road for me.&#160; The iPad had been in a black Belkin neoprene case I had purchased for my Kindle DX while I waited for Amazon to deliver my Speck CandyShell case, and the zipper was now ruined, so my brother left the tearing open of the case to me.&#160; What did I find inside, after a 5 foot fall going 30 mph and then (as I would soon discover) having been run over by another car?&#160; Here are the photos…</p>  <p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0200.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_0200" border="0" alt="IMG_0200" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0200_thumb.jpg" width="184" height="244" /></a> <a href="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0206.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_0206" border="0" alt="IMG_0206" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0206_thumb.jpg" width="184" height="244" /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0208%5B1%5D.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_0208[1]" border="0" alt="IMG_0208[1]" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0208%5B1%5D_thumb.jpg" width="184" height="244" /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0201.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_0201" border="0" alt="IMG_0201" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0201_thumb.jpg" width="184" height="244" /></a> <a href="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0202.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_0202" border="0" alt="IMG_0202" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0202_thumb.jpg" width="184" height="244" /></a></p>  <p>&#160;<a href="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0205.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_0205" border="0" alt="IMG_0205" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0205_thumb.jpg" width="184" height="244" /></a> <a href="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0204.jpg"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="IMG_0204" border="0" alt="IMG_0204" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPadbecomestoughPad_8D6A/IMG_0204_thumb.jpg" width="184" height="244" /></a> </p>  <p>As you can see, clearly the device was run over, likely while laying glass-down in the case on the road, by a vehicle.&#160; The device though continues to work PERFECTLY.&#160; The screen has two areas showing some extra brightness where I suspect it is being pressed on from the rear, but despite this incredible event that I would have expected most devices to have been destroyed by, the iPad came through a little worse for wear but otherwise unscathed.&#160; The sides of the aluminum case are puckering away from the screen slightly, and the corners are roughed up a bit, but overall it came through amazingly well.</p>  <p>Thank you Apple for a quality product, and saving me from being killed by my wife when she heard about this event.</p>
