<p>There is simply no telling when you'll pick up interesting bits of information.</p><p>While I was in the gift shop yesterday at William's Square, I struck up a conversation with the shop owner about Indian Cuisine.  I've been trying for some time to track down a place to get fresh curry leaves in the Metroplex, and she pointed me right to a perfect place.  A small grocery and import store in Irving at O'Connor and 183, near the Albertsons (might be Tom Thumb) that is on the corner.  Bombay Imports, I believe she said it was called.   I'll have to track that down sometime soon and check it out.</p>
