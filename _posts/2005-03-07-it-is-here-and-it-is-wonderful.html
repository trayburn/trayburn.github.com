<p>Well, the Tablet has arrived and here are my impressions with only 1 weekend under my belt. </p><ol><li>Wow ... that's light. My previous Sattelite from Toshiba now feels like a brick </li><li>Loving Ink. Alot. I'm someone who naturally does alot of hand notes and drawings. I'm officially out of the business of losing them from now on. </li><li>That said, you can't replace the keyboard. It's just to slow for alot of things. I find myself opening the tablet to laptop mode more than I fooled myself into believing I would prior to getting it. </li></ol><p>Overall ... love it!</p>
