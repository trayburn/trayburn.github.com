<p>So I had a chance today to attend a session given Anders Hejlsberg on C# 4.0, and beyond.&nbsp; Honestly I walked out of the session going ... that's it?&nbsp; The feature list started with the dynamic keyword, which is cool but simply does not help the 80% of C# developers today.&nbsp; Most C# developers today are so bound to type safety that dynamic will give them even more heartburn than var did.&nbsp; Now in reality it will likely make scenarios like property movement from service contracts to domain objects easier, but all its really doing is the same thing I blogged about the other day when working against .NET types, just with more layers and interfaces so that it can be built into the language directly.</p> <p>The next big thing mentioned was Named and Missing parameters.&nbsp; In the talk be mentioned that these should have been there long ago and he's absolutely right about that. As such, you'll get no big congratulations from me.</p> <p>What else?&nbsp; Co-variance and Contra-variance of course ... a couple of things on this.&nbsp; First, I don't think a lot of people will care.&nbsp; Second, perhaps I'm slow but I have no idea why a new keyword is needed for this.&nbsp; If a type is being used only as an input, then the compiler can detect that and add the "in" keyword, and if it is output only, then add "out".&nbsp; Why do I need to personally decorate this?&nbsp; Are their edge cases? Probably, but then have an opt-out model where you can take direct control only if needed.</p> <p>The C# 5.0 stuff about the compiler as a service is ... sexy.&nbsp; That is a concept that excites me, but that's just teaser stuff right now and they have no idea how/when they'll deliver.&nbsp; But what about other stuff?&nbsp; How about extension properties?&nbsp; What about interface inference (which is a major step towards duck typing)?&nbsp; I don't see a bunch of "type safe" enterprise developers getting excited about C# 4.0 as presented.&nbsp; They might think its cool, but will they use it like they use automatic properties or LINQ?&nbsp; I think not.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:0767317B-992E-4b12-91E0-4F059A8CECA8:a4d4deee-d388-4fe6-ab6b-6314e05e975b" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px">Technorati Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tags/pdc2008" rel="tag">pdc2008</a>,<a href="http://technorati.com/tags/C#" rel="tag">C#</a></div>
