<P><A href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/10/liabilities_and.html">Bruce Schneier has written an editorial on his blog and for Wired</A> which takes issue with the position put out by a former White House technology adviser that developers should be held personally responsible for security problems in the code they write.&nbsp; Bruce feels that this is not wise at all ... as a developer, I completely disagree.</P><P>Bruce's analysis of the market forces involved in ensuring that security improves is dead on, which means for the proposal of developer liability to work means that developers must have a greater stake in the marketability of the code they write.&nbsp; As a consultant I can say I welcome the idea, and so should any full-time corporate developer.&nbsp; Personal liability would guarantee that my rates would rise considerably to cover that risk, and that I would insist that if I am personally liable for code that I produce then I will keep the right to use that code on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; It would shake up programming as we know it, forcing businesses to realize that the developers on a project could not be treated as mere resources but would be far closer akin to partners in a project.</P><P>Now, it would have some downsides.&nbsp; Programming is already incredibly hard to get started in, especially if you come into the industry from a non-traditional vector (i.e. not from College).&nbsp; Personal liability would make new programmers yet more of risk and you may very well see some talented young minds who made a mistake go down in flames.&nbsp; It would also force business types to change the entire compensation model for programmers in radical ways.</P><P>Is this likely to happen? Of course not!&nbsp; Bruce is absolutely correct about the "right" way for government to address this problem.&nbsp; But as for me and my pocketbook, I wouldn't mind if the government tried to something like this proposal.</P><P>&nbsp;</P>
