<p>I've never been able to get myself motivated to pursue the Microsoft certifications in the past, the value proposition for me as a BizTalk Server developer was never there.&nbsp; First, for a long time there were no BizTalk certifications, and even once they created such certifications I was never asked about them when pursuing positions.</p> <p><a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/PearsonVue_logo.gif" atomicselection="true"><img alt="PearsonVue_logo" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/PearsonVue_logo_thumb.gif" align="right" border="0"></a> But some of that has changed, first I now work for a Microsoft Gold Partner and the more certified people they have on staff, the easier it is for them to maintain that status.&nbsp; Secondly I'm currently engaged in some internal planning and as part of that it was going to be very helpful if I knew just exactly what was required to achieve the BizTalk certification.&nbsp; Enter TechEd and PearsonVue...</p> <p><a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/MCTS-BizTalk-Logo.gif" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 10px" alt="MCTS-BizTalk-Logo" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/MCTS-BizTalk-Logo_thumb.gif" align="left" border="0"></a> On Monday and Tuesday at TechEd 2007 I had some free-time, some by choice because none of the tracks interested me, some because the sessions I wanted to attend were canceled.&nbsp; PearsonVue had a testing center setup at TechEd and had lowered the exam cost to $50 per test.&nbsp; That was well within the area at which I could "risk" the money on not passing, so I decided to take 70-235 “Developing Business Process and Integration Solutions by Using Microsoft BizTalk Server 2006”.&nbsp; I've been working with BizTalk Server since 1999 when I was part of an organization doing Alpha and Beta adoption of BizTalk Server 2000.&nbsp; I know the product very well, but I still expected to fail because I have always had the impression that the certification exams covered minutia that you would not encounter in your day to day work with the product.&nbsp; Apparently I was wrong, I passed the exam and in so doing earned the "MCTS: BizTalk Server 2006" certification.</p> <p><a href="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/MCTS-Distributed-Logo.gif" atomicselection="true"><img style="margin: 10px" alt="MCTS-Distributed-Logo" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/WindowsLiveWriter/CertificationManiaorWhattodowithfreetime_93BD/MCTS-Distributed-Logo_thumb.gif" align="right" border="0"></a> So since I was pleasantly surprised by what was expected for that exam, I decided to take TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 – Application Development Foundation, which I also passed.&nbsp; That exam had allot of asynchronous questions on it, but I did well enough.&nbsp; So since I was now officially on a streak I went and took TS: Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 – Distributed Application Development, which I also passed.&nbsp; That means I've also met the qualifications for "MCTS: .NET Framework 2.0 Distributed Applications".</p> <p>Finally I did take, but not pass, the Web exam as well.&nbsp; It contains two question areas that I was weak on, and that was my undoing.&nbsp; Specifically it contains questions on Mobile web development, and "Deployment Scenarios" which are all about which Wizard/Tool you would use.&nbsp; Since almost all my deployment scenarios for Web are done manually because I understand what each of the files in the solutions do, I was weak on the tools which publish/copy your site for you.</p> <p>All in all, it was a good week, and I'm pleased with the quality of the certifications from Microsoft.&nbsp; It's not going to guarantee you an guru, but it will ensure you've got someone competent at the technologies.</p>
