6 months ago I
[wrote on this blog](http://timrayburn.net/blog/improving-is-looking-to-pay-you-to-learn/)
that my company, Improving Enterprises, was looking to hire people and train
them how to be developers.  We did that, successfully, and we have 6 new
consultants working at various clients now.  I'm making a note here, HUGE SUCCESS!

Today I'm pleased to announce that we're **doing it again**.  We're looking for
another crop of people to jump into the fray, who want to aggressively learn
for the next 3 months.  Here are the details, repeated from the last time.

## What we expect from you

* Some programming experience is necessary.
  * Web experience is not necessary, though it is helpful.
  * Lack the experience or expertise to be an Improver
* Exhibit excellent potential, aptitude, and attitude
* Are willing to work long and hard over the next few months to become an Improver.

## What you can expect from the program

* You will be paid a nominal salary.
* The salary will increase once you pass the board exam and become billable.
* The program is 9-6 plus homework assignments including user group attendance
  and supplemental online courses.
* It is intended to be an intensive, â€œdrink from the firehose" experience.
* There is an interview process.
* The program will last 12 weeks, and moving into a full time consultant role with
  Improving is not guaranteed, it will be dependent on your performance.
* The program will start last week of September or first week of October.

If this excites you, then reach out to me at Tim@TimRayburn.net or on Twitter/GitHub @TRayburn and we'll get you started in the process.
