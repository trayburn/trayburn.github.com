<p>I should have taken time to write this post a while ago, but life's been a bit hectic.&nbsp; Microsoft has hired three new Evangelists over the last few months for the Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana area.&nbsp; I've had a chance to meet all three of them and I'm looking forward to seeing them flourish in their roles.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/chkoenig/">Chris Koenig</a> is the new Developer Evangelist for the region.&nbsp; His is moving to the Dallas/Fort Worth area right now from San Antonio and will be focused on evangelizing the "How" of Microsoft's development tools.</li> <li><a href="http://blog.austinwheats.net/default.aspx">Phil Wheat</a> joins as the new Architect Evangelist for the region.&nbsp; He has a strong background with Sharepoint and is a very engaging guy.&nbsp; If you attended Dallas Code Camp 2 you might have had a chance to meet him.&nbsp; He is based out of Austin but I'm sure he'll be seen in Dallas more than a little.</li> <li>Zain Naboulsi join as the new MSDN Developer Evangelist and is focused on the MSDN events through the region.&nbsp; I had a very nice chat with Zain, who also attended Dallas Code Camp 2, and I think the community will see more of him than you might have traditionally expected to from someone with his focus.</li></ul> <p>Welcome to these gentlemen and I wish them nothing but the best in their positions.&nbsp; I also remind the community to go easy on these guys for a while, they are all brand new to Microsoft, and Chris is brand new to the D/FW area, so it will take them a while to get completely hooked in.</p>
