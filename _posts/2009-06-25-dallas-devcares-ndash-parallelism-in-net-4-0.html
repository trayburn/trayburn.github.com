<p><a href="http://www.dallastechfest.com">Dallas TechFest</a> is behind me, and now it is time to look forward.&#160; Forward to Visual Studio 2010, Forward to .NET 4.0.</p>  <p>Tomorrow (Friday, June 26th) I will be presenting at the <a href="http://www.dallasdevcares.com/">Dallas DevCares</a> event on Parallelism in .NET 4.0.&#160; This talk is one I’ve given before, but two things will be different this time.&#160; First, I will be presenting with the use of Visual Studio 2010 Beta 1, so you will see how this actually works on actual .NET 4.0 bits.&#160; Second, I will be presenting for a somewhat longer time than my usual User Group talk, we will be have time to take lots of questions, and to cover some fundamentals that I might not normally cover at this talk.</p>  <p>I’d love to see any of my readers and followers there, <a href="http://www.dallasdevcares.com/">so cruise over to their website and register.</a></p>
