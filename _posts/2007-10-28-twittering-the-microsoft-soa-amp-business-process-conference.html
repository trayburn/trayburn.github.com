<p>I'm at the <a href="http://www.mssoaandbpconference.com/">Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference</a> this week, and presenting on Friday on BizTalk 2006 R2 and HIPAA Transactions.&nbsp; Starting bright and early on Monday morning, I'll be <a href="http://twitter.com">Twittering</a> my progress through the day, any big announcements and any little observations.&nbsp; I will of course have more than one blog post from this week as well, but if you want your "live and up to date" information, then now is the time to start <a href="http://twitter.com/TRayburn">following me in Twitter</a>.</p>
