<p>I've long been a fan of <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Default.aspx">The Daily WTF</a>, if you're a professional developer you owe it to yourself to take 3 minutes each day to read the posts there.&nbsp; Fabulous stuff.</p> <p>Alex, the man in charge at The Daily WTF, is <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/forums/thread/94341.aspx">kicking off a new service</a> called <a href="http://www.hiddennetwork.com">Hidden Network</a>.&nbsp; The idea is using blogs as a recruitment area for technology positions because those who read blogs are generally the "top talent".&nbsp; I'm keenly interested in participating in this experiment because I agree with Alex that this is the key dillema in our industry.&nbsp; A paradigm shift has to happen, and with any luck this could become such.</p> <p>I agree with those who posted in the comments that the key to making this work is transparency though.&nbsp; The company has to be willing to step out into the open by name so you know who they are and can examine their reputation before responding.</p>
