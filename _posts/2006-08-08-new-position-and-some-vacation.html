<IMG height=79 alt=Sogeti align="right" src="http://www.timrayburn.net/content/binary/Sogeti_logo.jpg" width=359 border=0>So a fairly major change has happened in the last few weeks which I let pass without commenting here. A week ago I started a new position as a Principal Consultant with Sogeti USA. It's been a good several years making it on my own as a consultant working with my wife's company Tech-Knights, but it was time for a change. Sogeti is focused on a regional practice, which is really what I was looking for, but with global reach. My first assignment is with HealthMarkets, formerly UICI, which is great because I used to work for their sister company InsurData before it merged with HealthAxis. It's fun to see some of the same faces I used to work with in '99-'00.<BR><BR>After a week getting settled and helping with some small problems, I'm off for a week on vacation to visit Virginia and then go down to Charolette, North Carolina to attend the wedding of my brother-in-law Chad. It's been a while since I could take a vacation so it's nice to get away and clear my head.
