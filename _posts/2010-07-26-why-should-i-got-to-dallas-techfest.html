Well, today's your lucky day. If you haven't registered yet there's still time, and there's a big discount to boot! <a href="http://dallastechfest.com/">Register now</a> and use the discount code coldfusion to get in for only $25. That's right, a mere $25 for all this geeky goodness.” from <a href="http://blog.mattwoodward.com/attend-dallas-techfest-for-only-25">Matt Woodward</a> </li>    <li>“If you are unable to attend CFUnited and you are in or are able to travel to the Dallas, TX area you should really check out Dallas TechFest.&#160; I'll be speaking there again this year on Getting Started with Mura CMS Development.” from <a href="http://stevegood.org/blog/ill-be-speaking-at-dallas-techfest/">Steve Good</a> </li>    <li>“This year’s schedule features well-known and local speakers from across 6 different communities including .NET, Java, PHP, Adobe, ColdFusion, Apple and IT Pro.&#160; Registration is normally $50, but if you use the code “dotnet” you can get a $25 discount!&#160; Make sure you sign up today as space is filling up quickly” from <a href="http://chriskoenig.net/2010/07/20/time-for-dallas-techfest/">Chris Koenig</a> </li> </ul>  <p>If you haven’t registered yet, then what are you waiting for?&#160; Online registration is open for the another day or so, so head over to <a href="http://DallasTechFest.EventBrite.Com">http://DallasTechFest.EventBrite.Com</a> and use one of the discount codes above to register for only $25.&#160; Or, register at the door, but that will cost $60.&#160; Feel like registering ahead of time now?&#160; I thought so.</p>  <ul>   <p></p> </ul>
