title: "Virtual PC + SUSE 9.2 FTP Install = Learning Curve"

<p>As I am sure we all know, Virtual PC 2004 is sent from God.</p><p>I decided today that I was going to get a Virtual PC set up with SUSE 9.2 in order to push myself to look into the Mono Project a little more.  I figured this should be doable (I was right) and that it should be doable quickly (I was wrong).</p><p>A little inspection of the Novell site (<a href="http://www.novell.com/linux/suse">http://www.novell.com/linux/suse</a>) quickly dug up the appropriate location to download the FTP based installer in a nice little 64mb iso. Sweet.  Mount that as the CD drive for my VPC and it boots. Even Better.  Run the install and hit a brick wall.</p><p>Short story, several hours later I discover how to tell this FTP installer to actually do an FTP install instead of a DVD install and then hammer my head against <a href="ftp://ftp.suse.com/">ftp.suse.com</a> for a while, getting "File Not Found" errors until I discover an article <a href="http://usalug.org/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2891">here</a> posted by crouse about how to do an FTP install. technically for 9.1, but it got me up and running.</p><p>So I'm writing this as the initial FTP kernel is downloading and once I can select my packages I'm off to sleep.  Tommorow if I have the time I'll post my own article addressing everything learned from this in order to save some other poor developer the heart-ache later.</p>
