<P>I'm writing about this in the hopes that no one else ever has to suffer the way I just did trying to get a BizTalk install configured at a client site.&nbsp; </P><P><STRONG>The symptom</STRONG> was that it would start to configure, reach the BTS WMI phase of the process and suddenly end with an "Unspecified Error".&nbsp; If you review the log file you would find error 80004005 was returned from btswmi.cpp and absolutely no other useful information.</P><P><STRONG>The cause</STRONG> of this problem is that NetBIOS is being used to determine if your computer is already in a BizTalk Group.&nbsp; NetBIOS only supports machine names of LESS than 15 characters.</P><P><STRONG>The solution</STRONG> is to rename your machine to something with less than 15 characters.&nbsp; This will of course take a Domain Admin in a domain situation.</P><P><STRONG>The gotcha</STRONG> is if like me you run off an immediately rename, you can be left with orphaned jobs on your SQL Server if it is on the same box.&nbsp; The sys_jobs table contains the machine name.&nbsp; Before you rename, be sure to remove any BizTalk jobs which were created or if you forget like I did, open Query Analyzer and update sys_jobs to have the new correct computer name.&nbsp; If you do not update sys_jobs Enterprise Manager will not let you delete the jobs, and the BizTalk configure will now fail even earlier in the process.</P><P><STRONG>The other gotcha</STRONG> is that your BizTalk Administrators Group will not longer have access to SQL Server because it will be known by it's fully qualified name &lt;machine&gt;/BizTalk Administrators and so you will need to give this group rights to the SQL Server again.</P>
