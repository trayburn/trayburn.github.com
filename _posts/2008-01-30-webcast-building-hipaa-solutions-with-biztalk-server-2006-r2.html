<p>Great news!&nbsp; When I attended and spoke at the Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference I was informed that they were recording all sessions to be included in a DVD of the event which would be sent out to those who had attended.&nbsp; Great, wonderful, but not a lot of use to my blog readers.&nbsp; Well shortly there after I received a request from the TechNet team to include my presentation as part of the &quot;Best Of&quot; from event online.&nbsp; I happily agreed, and am happy to report that the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/emea/spotlight/event.aspx?id=84">best of the Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference can now be found on TechNet</a>, and that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/emea/spotlight/sessionh.aspx?videoid=765">my presentation on Building HIPAA solutions with BizTalk Server 2006 R2</a> is amongst them.&nbsp; Incidentally apparently I received a 5 of 5 rating during the conference, I thank the attendees for being so easy on me.</p>
<p>This talk is actually very relevant to anyone interested in EDI for BizTalk Server 2006 R2 as the HIPAA specific pieces are few.&nbsp; It is a good introductory talk, it is not a deep internals talk but it does cover the configuration and setup of EDI/HIPAA in R2 in some depth.&nbsp; If you're interested in this topic and can't get to an event where I'm speaking, this is a nice alternative.</p>
