<p>I'm pleased to announce that my (long idle) project MapCop has a new release.</p> <p>In case you don't know MapCop is a program that analyzes BizTalk maps and produces a report which alerts you to style problems early.&nbsp; At the current time it has only two rules, but I expect to do allot of work on it over the next several weeks to expand those rules further.</p> <p>I'm also interested in recruiting help from other BizTalk developers who might be interested.&nbsp; If you'd like to join the team, please drop me a comment and be sure to include an email address where you can be reached.</p> <p>In the meantime, <a href="http://codeplex.com/MapCop">head over to CodePlex</a> and check out the 0.2 bits and source.</p>
