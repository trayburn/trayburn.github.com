<p>One of the things that I have had to do as a consultant is get used to moving from location to location.&nbsp; Even if I'm at a client for many months, I'll often be moved around their facility because I'm not permanently moving in.&nbsp; This has meant that I've developed quite the interesting bit of tooling to help me keep a portable office.&nbsp; So there are a few different areas of concern:</p> <ul> <li>Organization</li> <li>Network Connectivity</li> <li>Content Capture &amp; Playback</li> <li>Computing Resources</li> <li>Fallback Plans</li> <li>Personal Comfort</li></ul> <p>This is a run down of what I carry, and what I think of it.&nbsp; My bag is not perfect, as you'll be able to see from my reviews, but it works for my needs.&nbsp; What works for you will likely be different, but there will likely be overlaps and this list should prompt some ideas.</p> <p>I'll update this post with links to each of the posts as I get them up over the next week.</p>
