<P>I will be speaking to the <A href="http://www.fwdnug.com">Fort Worth .NET User Group</A> on Tuesday November 8th.&nbsp; They've asked me to speak on Test Driven Development and so it will be an evening on Red-Green-Refactor.&nbsp; I hope to shed some light on Agile methodologies in general as well as talk about tools which make TDD easier, most notably of course <A href="http://www.nunit.org">NUnit</A>.</P><P>If you're in the area, please be sure to check out their website and plan on attending.&nbsp; Admission is free and there are always great prizes to be had and free pizza for all attendees.</P>
