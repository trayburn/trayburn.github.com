<p></p> <p>Last year I had the pleasure of meeting <a href="http://www.computerzen.com">Scott Hanselman</a> (<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/Reflector5ReleasedWorldDominationAssured.aspx">who also talked about this subject today</a>) when he was in town to speak at the <a href="http://www.ddnug.net">Dallas .NET User Group</a> and <a href="http://www.nddnug.net">North Dallas .NET User Group</a>. I told him "I'm paid more today because of you, thanks." and he quipped that perhaps he should setup a "Hanseltax". Well I don't know that I'm ready to start forking over cash to Scott just yet, he costs me enough in gadgets already, but I might just be convinced that a "RoederTax" is necessary after the release of Reflector 5.0.<p><a href="http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet">Lutz Roeder's Reflector</a> is a must have for all .NET developers, period, full stop. If you don't have this on your box yet, stop reading this right now and go download it. The latest version includes the ability to set a display font size, which I much appreciate given the 1400x1050 resolution of my Toshiba M200 Tablet, and an incredible new Custom Protocol Handler registered to code://.<p>Why is this so incredibly cool? Because now it becomes possible to link directly to methods from a blog post. For instance if I'm writing about XML, as I'm like to do from time to time, I might say you need to check out <a href="code://System.Xml:2.0.0.0:b77a5c561934e089/System.Xml.XmlReader/Create(System.IO.TextReader,System.Xml.XmlReaderSettings):System.Xml.XmlReader">System.Xml.XmlReader</a> and if you've got Reflector 5.0 installed it will open Reflector and open that exact method for you to examine.<p>There are a ton of other features in Reflector 5.0, but I doubt that many will be affecting my life as quickly as this one. Lambda Expression, LINQ syntax, C# 3.0/.NET 3.5 support are all great, but code:// will be used today!</p>
