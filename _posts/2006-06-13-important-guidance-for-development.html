<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Of recent I've been reminded for how uncommon "Common Sense" truly is.&nbsp; To that end, I submit a list of rules which every company engaged in software development should adopt.</FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Titles Should Be Meaningless<BR></STRONG>Far to often titles are used in modern Corporate America to give an inflated view of importance or responsibility.&nbsp; What someone's title in an organization is should be meaningless.&nbsp; What should be important is what value they bring to the organization.</FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Team Cohesiveness Should Rule<BR></STRONG>A team should be composed of people who respect one another's opinions and contributions.&nbsp; Far to often I've seen a team dragged through the mud by one person's whose attitude towards the work has become bitter.&nbsp; These people are poison to everyone around them.&nbsp; With understanding to personal life issues, they should be moved away from the team until they can return with a positive attitude towards the work.</FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Teams Should Be Dynamic<BR></STRONG>A team should consist of those needed to perform the work at the moment. If someone is not necessary for this phase of a project, then they shouldn't be on the team until they are needed.&nbsp; Hording talented resources makes them bored.&nbsp; Bored talented people get employed by your competitors.</FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Cut Down Bureacracy<BR></STRONG>Managers should exist to cut through red-tape, not create it.&nbsp; If your job is to manage development resources you should spend most of your time each day allowing them to be creative and solve problems.&nbsp; Your team should feel comfortable calling you with the smallest concerns and knowing you will get things done in a timely manner.&nbsp; Your a member of the team to.</FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Be Honest And Keep Your Promises<BR></STRONG>Try to straight forward in all your communications.&nbsp; If there is change coming, tell people as soon as you can.&nbsp; Make certain that you avoid obfuscation whenever possible.&nbsp; The more open communications are, the more powerful the organization will be because little known talents can be taken advantage of.<SCRIPT><!--D(["mb","</font></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><font face\u003d\"Arial\" size\u003d\"2\">Consistantly Reward Performance<br>Even the most \ntalent people need motivations to keep going and giving their best.  Look \nfor oppurtunities to reward excellence outside of a paycheck.  Budget for \nsuch things as needed, but make them spontaneous as you can.</font></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><font face\u003d\"Arial\" size\u003d\"2\">Keep Talent And Cut Chaff<br>Talented people in \ndevelopment are creative, outside of the box thinkers.  These people thrive \nwhen you gather many of them in the same place.  You need only look at the \noutput of Xerox\'s famed Palo Alto Research Center (XEROX PARC) to know that a \ngroup of talented creative people can change the world, not just an organization \nprovided that management believes in them.  Likewise people who aren\'t \nproducing are a drain on such creativity.  You\'ll get more done with 10 \ntalented people than you will with 10 talented people and 10 \nunder-producers.</font></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><font face\u003d\"Arial\" size\u003d\"2\">Focus On Small Problems<br>Attempting to solve &quot;Big \nProblems&quot; in a single large project has been the doom of almost every project \nthat has tried it.  Focus on small solutions that build towards a solving \nbig problems.  This path may seem to have many hills and valleys and be \nless grandeous, but the highway of large projects is littered with failed \ndeliverables and maintenance nightmares just out of sight over the \nhorizon.</font></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><font face\u003d\"Arial\" size\u003d\"2\">Expect Excellence<br>It is important to have high \nexpectations of your people, but it is doom to expect the impossible.  It \nis key that you speak with your first layer of leadership, not necessarily \nmanagement, on a regular basis about the reality of your goals.  They \nshould feel free to tell you when what being asked is simply not possible.  \nCreative and talented people will consistantly rise to meet the challenge which \nis difficult, but they will just as consistantly shut down and stop performing \nwhen asked to perform the impossible.",1]);//--></SCRIPT> </FONT></DIV><DIV>&nbsp;</DIV><DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><STRONG>Consistantly Reward Performance<BR></STRONG>Even the most talent people need motivations to keep going and giving their best.&nbsp;
