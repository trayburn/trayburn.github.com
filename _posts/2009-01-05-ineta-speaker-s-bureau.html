<p>What a way to kick off the new year!&nbsp; I've just been notified (ok, it happened a few days ago but I was on vacation) that I've been selected to join the INETA NORAM Speaker's Bureau.&nbsp; Stupidly happy is a massive understatement, I am a huge fan of INETA's work getting great speakers to user groups throughout the United States and Canada, and I couldn't be more happy to join the ranks of speakers who will be delivering interesting, cutting edge content to user groups.</p> <p>When I informed my employer of this honor this morning, I used the analogy that I consider this the equivalent of being called up to the majors in baseball.&nbsp; It is an opportunity to shine, but it also means that I'm the rookie now no matter what I've done before.</p> <p>I will let everyone know once I'm in the system enough to be requested at your local user group.&nbsp; Also congratulation to all those who were selected at the same time I was, particularly my pal and fellow <a href="http://visualstuart.net/blog/2009/01/02/SelectedForINETASpeakersBureau.aspx">Connected Systems MVP Stuart Celarier.</a></p>
