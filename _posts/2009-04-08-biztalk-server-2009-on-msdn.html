<p>I’m thrilled to announce that BizTalk Server 2009 has become available on MSDN, as of last Saturday.</p>  <p>The 2009 release includes many cool things, but I’d like to highlight the unit testing capabilities that have been added to the product.&#160; With this release, there is now support for unit testing of Maps, Schemas and Pipelines.&#160; While not perfect, these features are a great initial down payment on bringing BizTalk development in line with state of the art practices in other development areas.&#160; I’m so thrilled that these features have been added that I will be doing a post series over the next several weeks on reducing the friction in unit testing these features, and you can look forward to the first installment shortly.</p>
