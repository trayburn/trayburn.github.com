I've started a new personal coding project called Hero Tracker which is a utility that grew out of some needs from my gaming group.  Not exactly rocket science right now, but I'm adding more and more features.  It's written in VB.NET and is using Datasets persisted to XML for the minimal amount of data access which it needs to accomplish.  As I add new features I'll probably mention more here, and eventually the source code will be made available as well.
