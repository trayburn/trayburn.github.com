<p>I've just had something of a weird coincidence of a week.  Try to follow along :</p><p>On a regular basis I read <a href="http://www.computerzen.com">Scott Hanselman's blog</a>, and recently in one of his posts he <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=74bdda37-d0e3-4055-a804-a5d509af4333">talked about XBoxFriends</a>.</p><p>XBoxFriends is a cut little program which scrapes a webpage to present you a well-formated list of your <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live">XBox Live</a> friends list in an MSN Messenger type program.  Scott listed the new website <a href="http://www.xboxfriends.com">www.xboxfriends.com</a> in his blog, so I went to check it out.</p><p>I decided to download the program and install it (XCopy Install!) and that website directed my to a post of the author's blog where he had posted the <a href="http://addressof.com/blog/posts/425.aspx">download</a>.  Cory Smith, the author, had on the site of his blog, a link to the <a href="http://www.fwdnug.com">Fort Worth Dot Net Users Group</a>.  It seems he is one of the officers, and they had a meeting this last Tuesday which I decided to attend.</p><p>The talk was given by <a href="http://www.jasonbock.net">Jason Bock</a> and was on the subject of attributes in .NET.  It was well presented, and I learned a great deal about metadata in .NET (not to mention about Jason, and his blog).</p><p>So, three blogs, one website, and a meeting later.  BTW .. XBoxFriends rocks, and my Gamertag is Gisben.</p>
