<h2>Backpack </h2> <p><img height="202" alt="Targus CityGear Chicago" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowToCreateaPortableOfficeOrganization_CCE3/Targus%20CityGear%20Chicago_caa31849-c7db-42b3-8a23-132954ca5529.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0"> For several years now I've used a Targus backpack to haul around my portable office.&nbsp; A good bag, one that you can trust and has space for what you want to carry is absolutely key.&nbsp; For me, as you will see below, this means I want a lot of space, with large cavernous storage areas.&nbsp; I find my use of other bags (see the next section) helps organize these large spaces without the waste of the designers trying to guess what I want to carry and what shape it will be.&nbsp; For instance, even my favorite CityGear Chicago bag comes with a cell-phone pouch, how useless is this?&nbsp; Cells change shape so often I swear we'll have a boomerang shaped one yet.&nbsp; Let me worry about organization, the backpack is about portability and accessibility.&nbsp; Some small amount of small pockets are great for high access items like pens, pencils, etc but I'll organize the rest, thanks.</p> <h2>Small Bags</h2> <h3></h3> <h3>Ziploc Bags</h3> <p><img height="202" alt="ZipLock Freezer Bags" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowToCreateaPortableOfficeOrganization_CCE3/ZipLock%20Freezer%20Bags_83ebc333-564a-4270-9a86-95199bd8b669.jpg" width="202" align="left" border="0">I love me some Zip-Lock Bags, these little creations are absolutely fantastic for organizing the internals of your backpack.&nbsp; Now, don't go overboard and turn into Monk or something, but these bags are great for organizing.&nbsp; I've had best luck with the Freezer bag variety because the plastic is tougher.&nbsp; Also, here's a hint : Punch small holes with a pencil in the sides of your bag.&nbsp; This will let things pack small easier as air can escape, and we're not looking to hold liquids in these anyway.</p> <h3>Other Bags</h3> <p><img height="180" alt="Mobile Bags" src="http://timrayburn.net/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/HowToCreateaPortableOfficeOrganization_CCE3/Mobile%20Bags_3a32e972-dbb0-49ba-924f-e20a2f2c68b0.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0"> There are endless other bags you might be able to use.&nbsp; Go to your favorite online mega-retailer and search on Zipper Pouch or Zipper Bag and you'll find them.&nbsp; I prefer bags which are more than two sides gusseted together so that I can fit larger items into them.&nbsp; At Tech-Ed 2007 I was given a couple of these wonderful bags (pictured right) which originally were printed with a Windows Mobile logo which has mostly peeled off the non-pictured side.&nbsp; These slightly padded bags have been carrying my portable hard disks and video camera ever since, and I'd love to have more of them (4-6 more would do if anyone has a stack of these in their office, <a href="mailto:tim@timrayburn.net">email me</a>).</p>
