<p>As you've undoubtedly noticed, I've begun to do more video as part of the blog over the last several weeks.&nbsp; As part of this experiment, I've started recording interviews with several people I've met along my travels.&nbsp; This series will be called "Who are you? What do you do?" and each time will be a one on one with someone I've met answering those two questions, and sometimes a few more.&nbsp; For the first installment, I present Dustin Hicks, Microsoft TS for BizTalk Server in the South Central district.</p> <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:63eded10-3302-4e2f-b00c-6c6f77cd4059" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><div><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qA5CqCs9QdU&amp;rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qA5CqCs9QdU&amp;rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></div></div>
