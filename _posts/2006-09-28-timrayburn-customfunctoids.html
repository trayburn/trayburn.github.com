<p>Another new post series that I've been meaning to start for a while.&nbsp; This post kicks off the development of a new project called TimRayburn.CustomFunctoids.&nbsp; The idea behind this project is that, in my not so humble opinion, there are several big gaps in the provided functiods that come with BizTalk.&nbsp; To that end, I intend to begin a library of functoids that can be used by anyone who would like them, subject to the license for all content on the blog.&nbsp; </p> <p>Here are the rules I will using to guide the creation of these functoids:</p> <ol> <li>As each functoid is completed, a new post to the blog will be created with the details of the implementation and the source code.<li>All functoids will have icons in the theme of the group in which they belong.&nbsp; For instance String functoids will have a red background, etc.<li>All functoid icons will have a bright blue border for the outer pixel to clearly mark them as being part of an external assembly.<li>All functoid ids will be incremented from a base value of 24,601. (Bonus Question : Where did I get the number 24,601?)<li>The goal of all functoids will be to make maps more clear, not less clear.&nbsp; Icons will be as descriptive as possible and you will not see functoids like "Lunar Moon Phase Functoid".</li></ol> <p>The first functoid that will be created is a pet peeve of mine ... Logical NOT.</p>
