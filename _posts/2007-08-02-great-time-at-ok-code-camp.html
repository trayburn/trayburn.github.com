<p>This last weekend I did a run up to the <a href="http://www.okcodecamp.com">Oklahoma City Code Camp</a> to give my "Introduction to C# 3.0" talk in the morning.&nbsp; I got to attend the keynote talk given by Jason Zander and it was great.&nbsp; He did a very good job showing off how XAML (be it WPF or <a href="http://www.silverlight.net">Silverlight</a>) allowed for powerful and graphically inviting UIs while still allowing developers to work in a way which they are accustomed to.</p> <p>Unfortunately I did not get to stay for the full day, as personal obligations called me back to Arlington.&nbsp; Still, if you get a chance to attend a Code Camp in your area, I would definitely go.&nbsp; Likewise if you have a chance to hear Jason talk, I'd go out of your way to make sure you do.</p>
