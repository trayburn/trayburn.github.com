I have a bad habit of collecting links and awesome tweets in the Twitter favorites and never recording them elsewhere.  This post, and others to follow in the series, are just a dump out of my favorites so they are permanently recorded somewhere.

## Must-Save Links

* via @EFF - [How to enable two factor authentication for nearly anything on the web](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/howto-two-factor-authentication-twitter-and-around-web)
* via @AmirRajan - [Permanently remove files and folders from a git repository](http://dalibornasevic.com/posts/2-permanently-remove-files-and-folders-from-a-git-repository)
* via @dahlbyk and @halfogre (indirectly) - [How to retrieve pull requests as branches from GitHub](https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247)

## Great Quotes 

> Password must contain a capital letter, a number, a plot, a protagonist with some character development, and a surprise ending.

from @JohnDashGreen

> Pro Tip: The message, "Password contains invalid characters" means your  security team, architects and IT people need to be fired.

from @NSelby
