<p>I've written about Model View Presenter (MVP) several times before, <a href="http://timrayburn.net/2006/10/12/ModelViewPresenter.aspx">once after hearing a talk and learning about the pattern,</a> and <a href="http://timrayburn.net/2007/04/29/InterfacesExtensionMethodsPOWER.aspx">again when I learned about extension methods</a>.</p>
<p>Today I bring you a screencast on Model View Presenter using Visual Studio 2008 and extension methods.&nbsp; This is my second screencast, and I've upgraded my microphone to a professional rig thanks to my father to improve the audio.</p>
