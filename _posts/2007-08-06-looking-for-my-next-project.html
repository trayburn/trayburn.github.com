<p>I've recently completed work on&nbsp;a project, and have begun the search for my next project.&nbsp; If you are in the greater Dallas/Fort Worth area, or don't mind remote workers, and have need of my expertise in BizTalk, C#, WCF, solutions architecture or anything else then please feel free to drop me a line at <a href="mailto:Tim@TimRayburn.net">Tim@TimRayburn.net</a>. </p>
