<p>I've just received word that one of the sessions I submitted has been accepted for the <a href="http://mssoaandbpconference.com/">Microsoft SOA &amp; Business Process Conference</a>.&nbsp; This is year is bound to be interesting coming just after the release of BizTalk 2006 R2 (scheduled for late September) and just before Visual Studio 2008 (scheduled for late November).&nbsp; I will be speaking on BizTalk 2006 R2 and HIPAA Transactions, a topic near and dear to my heart as I've done a great deal of work with both the HIPAA Accelerator and the Covast EDI Adapter for previous versions of BizTalk, and am currently working on a Proof-Of-Concept application for a claims clearinghouse using BizTalk 2006 R2.&nbsp; If you have a chance to get out to Redmond in late October, here are the details (<a href="http://zachbonham.blogspot.com/2007/07/microsoft-soa-and-business-process.html">hat tip to Mary Kay BizTalk Guru Zach Bonham</a>)</p> <p><a href="http://mssoaandbpconference.com/">http://mssoaandbpconference.com/</a> <p><strong>Who is invited to attend?</strong><br>Space will be limited, but anyone who is interested in SOA and Business Process should attend.<br><strong>Who should attend the conference?</strong><br>The conference is intended to educate and inform project managers, business managers, process owners/executives, IT/technical implementers, developers and business/technical consultants.
