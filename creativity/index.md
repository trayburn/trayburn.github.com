## BBQ & Grilling

Over the last several years I've become something of a fanatic when it comes to BBQ.  I own a Klose Backyard Chef, as well as Primo Oval XL, a Weber Smokey Mountain, and a propane grill.  I'm often found on weekends using my Stoker Powerdraft System to control 1 or more of these pits into smoking brisket, chicken, pork shoulder, pork loin, or other awesome food creations.

## Board / Computer / Console Games

I'm a huge fan of board games, and [organize a game night in Dallas](http://DallasGameNight.TimRayburn.net) where we play all sorts of games with players of all ages.  I'm also a member of the Dallas Game Marathon, and likely have 2-3 games on me at any moment we meet.  I'm known as something of a fanboy for deck building games, but I'll play nearly anything you're willing to teach.

I sporadically play several MMORPGs, specifically Star Wars : The Old Republic and Lord of the Rings Online, plus I dabble in a huge number of other games such as the Borderlands series, and others.  I've been known to play a few games of Hearthstone, and more.

I am heavily invested in the XBox ecosystem, and can be found at the GamerTag Gisben on XBox Live.  Feel free to send me a friend request, just include your real name so I know who you are.
