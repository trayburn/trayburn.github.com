## Board Games

I'm a huge fan of board games, and [organize a game night in Dallas](http://DallasGameNight.TimRayburn.net) where we play all sorts of games with players of all ages.  I'm also a member of the Dallas Game Marathon, and likely have 2-3 games on me at any moment we meet.  I'm known as something of a fanboy for deck building games, but I'll play nearly anything you're willing to teach.

## Computer Games

I sporadically play several MMORPGs, specifically Star Wars : The Old Republic and Lord of the Rings Online, plus I dabble in a huge number of other games such as the Borderlands series, and others.  I've been known to play a few games of Hearthstone, and more.

## Console Games

I am heavily invested in the XBox ecosystem, and can be found at the GamerTag Gisben on XBox Live.  Feel free to send me a friend request, just include your real name so I know who you are.
