I'm thrilled to announce that [Devlin Liles](http://devlinliles.com) and I have recently released an update to Highway.Data that is only a minor increment, but has a major new feature.  It now contains a totaling **In Memory** version of our DataContext.  This allows for much more interesting and easy unit testing, without the need to mock so many things.

Now, this is an introductory feature, and I'm sure there will be edge cases it won't cover correctly.  We welcome [bug reports on GitHub](https://github.com/HighwayFramework/Highway.Data/issues), as well as pull requests.
