For those who attended my GIT Workship last night at Dallas XAML, you can find the code and slides here: https://github.com/trayburn/Presentation-GitWorkshop

I've fixed the problems with my demo scripts that create repositories, so you can clone that repository locally and execute :

```
.\LocalDevelopment.ps1
```

For a basic repository example which you can use to practice roll-backs, etc.

```
.\BranchingDemo.ps1
```
This will create three branches from master, which you can practice merging, and rebase'ing with.

Thanks to those that attended, I hope you got something useful out of it.
