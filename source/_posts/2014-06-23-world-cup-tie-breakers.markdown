Alright, so Portugal pushed the United States into a tie in our match at the World Cup.  I've seen some **horrible** reporting on what this means this morning, where clearly the journalists could not be bothered to [read the regulations of the World Cup](http://resources.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/47/38/17/regulationsfwcbrazil2014_update_e_neutral.pdf), specifically pages 25 & 26 where the tie breaking rules are explained.

> In the league format, the ranking in each group is determined as follows:

> a) greatest number of points obtained in all group matches;

> b) goal difference in all group matches;

> c) greatest number of goals scored in all group matches.

> If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings shall be determined as follows:

> d) greatest number of points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned;

> e) goal difference resulting from the group matches between the teams concerned;

> f) greater number of goals scored in all group matches between the teams concerned;

> g) the goals scored away from home count double between the teams concerned (if the tie is only between two teams).

I'm specifically looking at [you NBC sports](http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2014/06/22/2014-world-cup-united-states-fifa-usa-group-g-tiebreaker-scenarios-advance) who indicated that we could be forced to draw lots in certain scenarios.  Every time their article says that, please note that it would be a `g)` scenario, which is not great for us, because we were the Home team against Portugal, as such their 2 points would suddenly count for 4 points against us.

Please, read the rules people.  Fortunately, for us, all of that only matters is the United States loses their match.  A Win or a Tie ensures our advancement.

If you're a Portugal or Ghana fan, then a United States v. Germany tie is your worst case scenario.  Any other result leaves **some** hope alive, though you strongly prefer a United States loss because of Germany's huge goal differential lead.  Either that, or you want the United States to win by 4 or more goals against Germany.

Thursday is going to be awesome. **#IBelieveThatWeWillWin**
