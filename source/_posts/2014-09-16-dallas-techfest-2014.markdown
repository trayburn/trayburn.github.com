I'm thrilled to announce that Dallas TechFest 2014 is a go, and boy is it a huge event!  

* We've got 5 tracks of amazing content.
* We've got UX, Mobile, JavaScript, and .NET content
* Lunch? yep we've got it.
* WiFi? yep that too!
* Great venue?  Absolutely, we're headed to the amazing Gilley's Dallas and taking their entire venue.

This event is awesome, and you can learn all about it at [the Dallas TechFest website](http://DallasTechFest.com).

Huge props to Brandon Ward and Michael Dudley for the amazing website this year, you guys rock.
